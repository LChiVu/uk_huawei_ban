LONDON (AP) - Britain can handle the security risks involved with using mobile networks made by China's Huawei, the cybersecurity chief said Wednesday, adding to a growing debate among countries on whether the company should be banned, as the U.S. wants.

Ciaran Martin, the CEO of the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre, said it was important to have ""sustainable diversity"" in the supply of telecommunications equipment. He added that his agency could handle the challenges involved in monitoring suppliers who may not be considered trustworthy - a hint at Huawei.

Huawei, the world's biggest maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, has faced rising scrutiny over U.S. allegations that it could be forced by the Chinese government to provide access to consumer data on its networks.

As countries roll out new high speed fifth generation, or 5G, mobile networks, they are seeking suppliers and the issue of whether to ban Huawei has become a heated debate.

Some frame it as a cold evaluation of the technical risks. Others see it as part of a broader tussle between the U.S. and China for technological dominance. The U.S. has effectively blocked Huawei for years and is accusing China of stealing technology from foreign companies.

U.S. government officials including Vice President Mike Pence publicly warned European allies against using Huawei during a visit last week.

Authorities and telecom operators in countries such as Germany, Norway and the Czech Republic have been reassessing Huawei's role in 5G networks while Australia, New Zealand and Japan have already moved to curb the use of its gear to varying degrees.

China has stridently defended Huawei, considered a crown jewel in its push to become a global technology power, and denounced security concerns as part of a U.S.-led plot to restrain the country's development.

""The United States and a few of its allies are using double standards and deliberately misleading the public on the issue,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday.

""It's hypocritical, immoral and unfair bullying behaviors,"" said Geng.

Experts say Huawei networks are generally cheaper than those of competitors and are of a high quality, making it a difficult decision for governments and telecom operators to shun the supplier altogether. Banning Huawei could also delay the rollout of 5G networks, which are considered necessary for the next generation of internet-connected things, from self-driving cars to smart factories.

The British government is due to complete a review of its policies on the safety of 5G in March or April.

Martin said no decisions have yet been made and ""everything is on the table.""

Since 2010, the British government has operated a cybersecurity evaluation center for Huawei equipment, which Martin said was part of ""the toughest and most rigorous oversight regime in the world"" for the company.

""And it is proving its worth,"" he said, according to a transcript of a speech he gave at a conference in Brussels.

The cybersecurity center in July identified technical issues in Huawei's engineering processes that could make it less safe. Huawei said last month that it would take three to five years to fix the problems.

Martin said the issues his agency identified relate to cybersecurity standards and are ""not indicators of hostile activity by China."" He told reporters that mistakes in software are the biggest issue for cybersecurity, more so than the risk of a foreign government getting backdoor access.

Huawei competes with a few big rivals, notably Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson, to supply equipment for 5G networks.

Martin said it's important not to let the telecom equipment supplier market shrink too much.

""Any company in an excessively dominant market position will not be incentivized to take cybersecurity seriously,"" Martin said, adding that such a company could be a ""prime target for attack for the globe's most potent cyber attackers.""

In a sign of Britain's division over 5G, a security think tank warned the same day against using Huawei gear.

""Allowing Huawei's participation is at best naive, at worst irresponsible,"" the Royal United Services Institute said in a report, which cited factors including the difficulty of finding hidden ""back doors"" in software.

Germany is still undecided on what to do. It has made clear it doesn't plan to explicitly bar any single manufacturer, though that leaves open the possibility it could frame system requirements in a way that effectively excludes Huawei.

Officials are wary of the security issues that could arise with Chinese involvement, and the German Interior Ministry said Wednesday that internal discussions were still ongoing on how to proceed.

""A direct exclusion of a particular manufacturer from the 5G expansion is at the time not legally possible and also not planned,"" the Interior Ministry told The Associated Press. ""For the Interior Ministry the focus is on adapting the security requirements of the telecommunications network in such a way that the security of the network remains guaranteed, including from possibly non-trustworthy manufacturers.""

The ministry said for that to be ensured, the requirements must be anchored in Germany's telecommunications law and discussions on how to do that are currently ongoing.

A bid to block the installation of new Huawei technology in the UK’s 5G network has passed its first Commons hurdle.

The Telecommunications (Security) Bill passed its second reading without a division and will now progress for further scrutiny.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the Commons the Bill is designed to tackle “not only the Huaweis of today but the Huaweis of tomorrow wherever they come from”.

He added: “It does need to be flexible enough to cover future threats and not tie our hands by limiting our response to one company and one company alone.”

The Bill would force providers to stop installing Huawei equipment in the UK’s 5G networks from next September and it also sets out a roadmap to remove high-risk vendors altogether.

Conservative former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the September 2021 date was “better than I would have expected”, before raising concerns about the UK’s Government past approach to China and suggesting a more formal structure to advise the Secretary of State on future decisions is required.

He added: “Otherwise it’ll be too easy for a Secretary of State under pressure from the Business Secretary, under pressure from a Chancellor – such as one which we once had (George Osborne) who was very keen on a golden era – leaning and saying ‘do you know what, do you really need to go down this road?’, that will happen.

“I sat as a Secretary of State, I can tell you now all that stuff happens and anybody else will tell you too.

“So, I think a more structured approach does not allow the Secretary of State to miss the right people on advice.”

In the summer, the Government announced that the Chinese firm was to be banned from the most sensitive core parts of UK networks.

It followed a growing backlash from Conservative backbenchers over a decision in January to allow Huawei technology in the UK’s 5G network, albeit with restrictions.

Tom Tugendhat, Conservative chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said the Government has listened to its backbenchers’ concerns.

He added: “The minister has done a very good job in listening. There was a time earlier this year when many of us thought this could become a very difficult issue for the Government.

“I have to say the minister and his entire department have done a fantastic job in listening, not just to this side of the House but the other and making sure that the points that we raised have been addressed.”

Labour’s shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said action to remove high-risk vendors from the UK’s telecoms networks must go hand in hand with measures to diversify the supply chain.

She said: “Let’s be frank, until this year the Government had failed to face reality.

“We will not oppose the second reading of this Bill, but we have many concerns which will need to be considered and addressed at committee stage because the Bill this House eventually passes must take steps to ensure that our telecoms supply chain is resilient in the future or we’ll be forced to return here again in a short time to deal with the next Huawei.

“We must be mindful as with all legislation that we seek to anticipate the problems of the future rather than just deal with the issue we face today. We, of course, fully support steps to remove high-risk vendors from the network, but they absolutely must go hand in hand with credible measures to diversify the supply chain.”

The Bill will force the removal of all Huawei equipment from 5G networks by 2027 and create national security powers capable of imposing controls on when – if at all – a telecoms firm could use material supplied by companies such as Huawei.

The Government has published a 5G Supply Chain Diversification Strategy to ensure the UK is “never again dependent on a handful of telecoms vendors”.

Under the legislation, security protocols around UK networks will also be strengthened with fines – of 10% of turnover or £100,000 a day – for those who do not meet the new standards.

Feb 17 (Reuters) - British security officials do not support a full ban of Huawei from national telecoms networks despite U.S. allegations the Chinese firm and its products could be used by Beijing for spying, people with knowledge of the matter said.

Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with the Chinese government and allegations of enabling state espionage, with the United States calling for its allies not to use its technology.

Although no evidence has been produced publicly and Huawei has denied the claims, the allegations have led several Western countries to restrict its access to their markets.

""We don't favour a complete ban. It's not that simple,"" one of the sources told Reuters on Monday after a Financial Times report on Sunday said that Britain had decided it could mitigate the risks of using Huawei equipment in 5G networks.

The FT cited two sources familiar with what it said was a conclusion by the government's National Cyber Security Council (NCSC), which last year said technical and supply-chain issues with Huawei's equipment had exposed national telecom networks to new security risks.

While Huawei did not offer a direct comment on the NCSC conclusion, its rotating chairman Eric Xu said the company had been working with various governments to come up with standards to measure the safety and security of products.

""In this context, Huawei has been working with different governments and industry partners to put in place agreed standards, so that people can take those standards to measure how secure the products from all of the vendors are,"" Xu told Reuters in an emailed statement on Monday.

Any decision to allow Huawei to participate in building next-generation 5G networks would be closely watched by other nations, because of Britain's membership of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group with the United States.

Britain is an important market for Huawei and last month Vodafone, the world's second-largest mobile operator, said it was ""pausing"" the deployment of its equipment in core networks until Western governments give the Chinese firm full security clearance.

Other operators in Europe, including Britain's BT and France's Orange have already removed Huawei's equipment or taken steps to limit its future use.

Two sources said the NCSC did not think it was necessary to completely bar Huawei from British networks, believing it could continue to manage any risks by testing the products at a special laboratory overseen by intelligence officials.

Both sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the position was consistent with public statements made by the NCSC and British officials.

""As was made clear in July's HCSEC oversight board, the NCSC has concerns around Huawei's engineering and security capabilities. We have set out the improvements we expect the company to make, an NCSC spokeswoman said on Monday.

CONFIDENCE MEASURES

People with knowledge of the matter said the next NCSC report on Huawei's position in Britain will criticise its slow response to issues raised in last year's report and detail tense relations with British officials.

The report, which is expected to be released in coming weeks, does not itself set government policy.

The results of a government review of British telecoms infrastructure is expected later in the year and will include recommendations on managing security risks, including in future 5G networks.

Fellow Five Eyes member Australia has banned Huawei from supplying 5G equipment, while New Zealand said on Monday it would make its own independent assessment of the risk of using Huawei equipment in 5G networks.

Huawei has set up security labs in Britain and Germany aimed at building confidence that its equipment does not contain ""back doors"" for Chinese intelligence services.

It has also offered to build a cyber-security centre in Poland, where authorities have arrested a Chinese Huawei employee along with an ex-Polish security official.

Last week Alex Younger, the head of Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service, said it was more complicated than ""in or out"" when asked if Britain was seeking to manage risks perceived as being attached to Huawei rather than simply to ban it.

Younger also told journalists in Munich that it was not desirable that ""any piece of significant national infrastructure is provided from a monopoly supplier"".

LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson granted Huawei a limited role in Britain's 5G mobile network on Tuesday, frustrating a global attempt by the United States to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from the West's next-generation communications.

Defying Britain's closest ally in favour of China on the eve of Brexit, Johnson ruled that ""high-risk vendors"" such as Huawei would be allowed into the non-sensitive parts of the 5G network.

Whilst such high-risk companies' involvement will be capped at 35%, they will be excluded from the sensitive core, where data is processed, and they will be banned from all critical networks and locations such as nuclear sites and military bases.

Such an explicit rejection of U.S. concerns that Huawei could be used to steal Western secrets was welcomed by the Chinese firm, founded in 1987 by a former People's Liberation Army engineer, but dismayed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Johnson and Trump spoke by phone shortly after the decision was made public. ""The Prime Minister underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies,"" the British government said in a statement.

Speaking before the call, a Trump administration official said: ""There is no safe option for untrusted vendors to control any part of a 5G network.

""We look forward to working with the UK on a way forward that results in the exclusion of untrusted vendor components from 5G networks.""

U.S. congressional leaders widely criticized Britain's decision, with powerful Republican Senator Lindsey Graham saying it could ""greatly complicate"" drawing up a new trade agreement after Britain exits the European Union on Jan. 31.

A British official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said excluding Huawei would have delayed 5G and cost consumers more, echoing warnings from the telecoms industry.

5G's much faster data speeds and increased capacity will make it the foundation stone of many industries and a driver of economic growth.

In what some have compared to the Cold War antagonism with the Soviet Union, the United States is worried that 5G dominance is a milestone towards Chinese technological supremacy that could define the geopolitics of the 21st century.

But as a critical centre for Chinese investment, trading and banking in Europe, Britain sided with Beijing, in one of the biggest public breaks with Washington in decades.

""I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing,"" said Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, adding there should be a review of intelligence sharing with Britain.

Canada, which has yet to decide whether to allow the use of Huawei 5G technology, said it was studying Britain's decision.

CHINA VS USA

The United States had repeatedly warned London against allowing Huawei into 5G, arguing the distinction between ""edge"" and ""core"" will blur as data is processed throughout 5G networks, making it difficult to contain any security risks.

""If Huawei is allowed into any part of your network, it is allowed into every part of your network,"" said Tim Morrison, who until recently was a senior director at the White House's National Security Council.

Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, has said the United States wants to frustrate its growth because no U.S. company could offer the same range of technology at a competitive price.

""This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that's fit for the future,"" Huawei's vice president Victor Zhang told reporters.

The only other large-scale telecoms equipment suppliers are Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia.

Huawei has invested heavily to achieve market leadership, despite being excluded from U.S. networks. Zhang said it spent $15 billion last year on research.

In 2018, it committed to invest 3 billion pounds in Britain, a country Huawei views as a global innovation hub and strategic location, Zhang said.

Huawei UK vice president Jeremy Thompson said the 35% cap was ""pretty much in line with its expectations"".

""We welcome the diversity element and that's what I'm sure our customers will be looking for as well,"" he told reporters.

Huawei has around a 35% share of the non-core 4G mobile network in Britain, a government document said last July.

INTELLIGENCE

Britain said the decision protected national security while delivering world-class connectivity. It said intelligence-sharing, including with the U.S.-led 'Five Eyes' alliance, would not be jeopardized.

""How we construct our 5G and full fibre public telecoms networks has nothing to do with how we will share classified data,"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told lawmakers after a meeting of the UK's National Security Council chaired by Johnson.

""Intelligence-sharing will not be put at risk...""

British cyber security officials said they had put special measures in place to mitigate risks.

""We've never 'trusted' Huawei and the (measures) you can see ... exist because we treat them differently to other vendors,"" Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency, said in a technical post.

Huawei's equipment is already used by Britain's biggest telecoms companies such as BT and Vodafone, but it has been largely deployed at the edge of the network.

Sources told Reuters last week that senior British officials had proposed granting Huawei a limited 5G role, a ""calculated compromise"" which could be presented to Washington as a tough restriction, while accepted by British operators.

A Bill that would give the Government greater powers to shut out high-risk vendors from the UK’s telecoms infrastructure will be laid before Parliament on Tuesday.

The Telecommunications (Security) Bill would create national security powers capable of imposing controls on when – if at all – a telecoms firm could use material supplied by companies such as Huawei.

In the summer, the Government announced that the Chinese firm was to be banned from the most sensitive core parts of UK networks, alongside plans to rip out all Huawei equipment from 5G networks by 2027 – decisions that would be enshrined in law by the new Bill.

Under the proposals, security protocols around UK networks will also be strengthened with fines, of 10% of turnover or £100,000 a day, for those who do not meet the new standards.

Communications regulator Ofcom is to be tasked with the monitoring and assessing of security protocols among telecoms providers.

“We are investing billions to roll-out 5G and gigabit broadband across the country but the benefits can only be realised if we have full confidence in the security and resilience of our networks,” Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said.

“This groundbreaking Bill will give the UK one of the toughest telecoms security regimes in the world and allow us to take the action necessary to protect our networks.”

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said that current-self governance laws in place did not work.

They said that telecoms providers were currently responsible for setting their own security standards but the Government’s Telecoms Supply Chain Review found they often had little incentive to adopt the best security practices.

It said the new duties set out in the Bill would set minimum security standards for firms to reach, while new codes of practice will be introduced to help providers comply with their legal obligations around high-risk vendors.

Dr Ian Levy, technical director at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said: “The roll-out of 5G and gigabit broadband presents great opportunities for the UK but as we benefit from these we need to improve security in our national networks and operators need to know what is expected of them.

“We are committed to driving up standards and this bill imposes new telecoms security requirements which will help operators make better risk management decisions.”

The majority of IT professionals do not believe the UK’s decision to ban Huawei from 5G will cause long-term damage to the country, new research indicates.

Following the Government’s decision to strip out Huawei equipment by 2027, the Chinese company warned it would “move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide”.

However, a survey by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, found that 53% of IT professionals do not agree with that statement, while just over half (51%) said they felt Huawei’s removal would make the UK network safer.

The Government’s decision on Huawei followed advice from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which said US sanctions imposed on the firm would compromise its ability to safely be a part of 5G networks.

Ahead of the full removal target of 2027, a ban on the purchase of new Huawei 5G equipment will come into force at the end of this year.

The survey of just under 3,000 industry professionals, carried out in response to the decision, found that 48% felt that the 2027 target was feasible, compared to 27% who said they felt it would not be possible.",,,,,,,,,huawei ban wont damage uk tech industry say expert press association published august updated august email email top home majority professional believe uk decision ban huawei g cause longterm damage country new research indicates following government decision strip huawei equipment chinese company warned would move britain digital slow lane push bill deepen digital divide however survey bcs chartered institute found professional agree statement half said felt huaweis removal would make uk network safer government decision huawei followed advice national cyber security centre ncsc said u sanction imposed firm would compromise ability safely part g network ahead full removal target ban purchase new huawei g equipment come force end year survey industry professional carried response decision found felt target feasible compared said felt would possible

LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A delegation of U.S. officials will arrive in Britain on Monday to try to persuade Britain not to use Huawei equipment in the upgrade of its telecoms network, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday.

Britain is expected to make a final call on how to deploy Huawei Technologies equipment in its future 5G networks later this month.

Security minister Brandon Lewis told the BBC on Sunday a decision would be taken ""relatively soon"".

The U.S. delegation is expected to include deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, the two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

UK ministers must weigh U.S.-led allegations that the equipment could be used for Chinese state spying against Britain's relationship with Beijing and industry warnings that banning the firm outright would cost billions of dollars.

Huawei, the world's largest maker of mobile networking equipment, has repeatedly denied that its equipment could be used for spying. A company spokesman has previously said UK lawmakers had confirmed Huawei equipment would not be deployed in networks used for intelligence sharing.

One U.S. senator has introduced a bill that would prevent the United States from sharing intelligence with countries that allow Huawei Technologies to operate 5G network technology.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been expected to press British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab over Huawei when the pair met in Washington last week.

British defence Minister Ben Wallace told the Sunday Times that U.S. President Donald Trump and his advisers have threatened to cut off some intelligence to the UK if the National Security Council gives Huawei a green light.

""It´s not a secret. They have been consistent. Those things will be taken into account when the government collectively decides to make a decision on it,"" Wallace said.

Editor's Note:

China-UK relations have been under growing strain recently due to UK's attitudes on issues such as Hong Kong, Huawei and Xinjiang. The situation has sparked concerns over whether the ""Golden Era"" between China and the UK has come to an end.

In an exclusive interview with the Global Times (GT) on Friday, Liu Xiaoming, Chinese Ambassador to the UK, made remarks on topics such as UK's recent ban on Huawei's 5G network, its responses to Hong Kong-related issues and the future of China-UK ties.

Ambassador Liu noted the UK now has ""understanding deficit"" and a ""trust deficit"" in its policies toward China. He called for promoting closer links instead of ""decoupling"" in order to promote trust, manage differences and remove the ""deficits.""

GT: With regard to the UK's recent decisions to change the policy for British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) passport holders, ban Huawei from its 5G networks, and suspend the extradition treaty with Hong Kong indefinitely, what countermeasures will China take?



Ambassador Liu: The UK Government, in disregard of China's solemn representations, is bent on carrying out political manipulation on the issues of BN(O) and the extradition treaty with Hong Kong. The Chinese side strongly opposes such acts of the UK side which openly go against its own pledge, violate international law and the basic norms governing international relations, and blatantly interfere in Hong Kong affairs, which are internal affairs of China. China will consider refusing to recognize BN(O) passports as valid travel documents and reserves the right to take further countermeasures.

On the issue of Huawei, the UK Government has contravened its previous decision and banned 5G equipment of Huawei, claiming the company poses ""risks"" without any evidence. This went against the principles of market economy and rules of free trade, jeopardized China-UK mutual trust, undermined the confidence of Chinese businesses in making investments in the UK, and intoxicated the atmosphere for China-UK business cooperation. The Chinese side will evaluate this decision comprehensively and seriously and take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies.

China-UK relationship has encountered serious setbacks due to the above-mentioned wrong remarks and deeds of the UK side. I have emphasized time and again that China is a partner of the UK, rather than a rival, still less an enemy; China's development creates opportunities for the UK, rather than challenges, still less threats. A steady and sound China-UK relationship is in the interests of both the two countries and beyond. I hope the UK side will return to an independent, reasonable and pragmatic China policy, and stop going down the wrong path. Otherwise, it will have to bear all the consequences.

GT: On the issue of BN(O), will China revoke the Chinese nationality or the right of abode in Hong Kong of the Hong Kong residents who have accepted the unilateral arrangements of the UK Government?



Ambassador Liu: It is made clear in the Explanations of Some Questions by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Concerning the Implementation of the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals, whether or not they are holders of the British National (Overseas) passport. In fact, as early as 1985 when the UK Government adopted the law to create the BN(O) status, it made the pledge that BN(O) passport holders who are Chinese citizens residing in Hong Kong shall not have the right of abode in the UK. Now the UK Government has gone back on its words and offered ""a route for BN(O) passport holders to apply for citizenship in the UK"". This decision is purely political manipulation, and its real intention is to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and disrupt the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong SAR. The Chinese side strongly opposes this. We will consider refusing to recognize BN(O) passports as valid travel documents and reserve the right to take further countermeasures.

Hong Kong has been returned to China and is now a special administrative region of China. Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs and brook no external interference in any form. We have urged the UK side, time and again, to recognize the fact that Hong Kong is part of China, immediately right the wrongs, and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form. Such interference will be self-defeating.

GT: With the UK suspending the extradition treaty with Hong Kong, what impact will it have on China, including Hong Kong? Will it affect the pursuit and arrest of fugitives? Will the Chinese side engage in further communications with the UK side through the diplomatic channel?



Ambassador Liu: The unilateral suspension of the extradition treaty by the UK side under the excuse of the National Security Law for Hong Kong SAR is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and severe violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations. The Chinese side strongly opposes this and reserves the right to take further countermeasures.

The extradition treaty was signed between Hong Kong SAR, with authorization of the Central Government of China, and the UK side, and there has been effective cooperation on law enforcement all along. The recent unilateral move of the UK side will undermine the basis for judicial cooperation between Hong Kong SAR and the UK, hamper cooperation and exchanges between the two sides on law enforcement, and make the UK a ""safe haven"" for fugitives hoping to escape justice in Hong Kong.

I hope the UK side will have a right and objective understanding of the National Security Law for Hong Kong SAR, right its wrongs, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, which are China's internal affairs in any form, and take concrete actions to foster favorable conditions for the sustained and sound development of China-UK relationship.

Global Times: In light of the recent situation, do you think the China-UK ""Golden Era"", which was unveiled in 2015, has come to an end? If not, do you think it is faced with grave challenges?

Ambassador Liu: The China-UK ""Golden Era"" was proposed by the UK side during President Xi Jinping's state visit to the UK in 2015. The Chinese side agreed with the UK side and supported this initiative because we believed that it was an accurate depiction of the development stage of China-UK relationship and served the interests of both countries. China has since then worked with the UK to advance the ""Golden Era"" of their important relationship.

""Golden Era"" should be based on mutual respect, equal treatment and mutual benefit. In particular, the two sides should respect each other's core interests and major concerns and abide by the basic norm of non-interference in international relations. It is, to a large extent, up to the UK side whether the ""Golden Era"" could continue.

GT: How do you see the future of China-UK relationship? Do you think there will be a continuous escalation of tension and serious confrontations between China and the UK, like what happened between China and the US?



Ambassador Liu: We feel deeply disappointed at the current difficulties and setbacks in China-UK relationship. The UK side should take full responsibility for the state this relationship has got into. China-UK relationship is at an important juncture. The UK side should carefully reflect on its attitude and policy toward China. I think it is extremely important to uphold the following two principles:

The first principle is to abide by the basic norms governing international relations. The UK was the first major Western country to recognize New China 70 years ago. Since then, China-UK relationship has kept moving forward despite twists and turns. History and facts prove that as long as the two sides adhere to the basic norms governing international relations, including mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, which are endorsed in the UN Charter, China-UK relationship will make progress; otherwise, it will encounter setbacks, or even retrogression. Recently the UK has made one mistake after another on issues related to Hong Kong and Xinjiang, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs and discrediting China. The Chinese side strongly opposes this. We urge the UK side to faithfully observe the basic norms governing international relations, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop flinging slanders at China.

The second principle is to have a right perception and strategic definition of China. Some British politicians have clung to the ""Cold War"" mindset and danced to the tune of the US. They see China as a challenge, a threat and even a ""hostile state"", threaten a ""reckoning"" of the UK's China policy, and even clamour for a ""new Cold War"" against China. In particular, the UK Government's recent change of its decision on Huawei, excluding Huawei from its 5G network, is wrong. This is not only about how the UK sees a Chinese company. More importantly, it is about how the UK sees and deals with China. Does it see China as an opportunity and a partner or a threat and a rival? Does it see China as a friendly country, or a ""hostile"" or ""potentially hostile"" state? On these issues of right and wrong, the UK should have a right perception and accurate strategic definition.

The UK aims to build a ""global Britain"" when Brexit is completed and COVID-19 is over, but it is hard to imagine a ""global Britain"" that bypasses or excludes China. The UK needs to coordinate and cooperate with China on international and regional issues, such as safeguarding multilateralism, supporting free trade, addressing global challenges such as climate change, and promoting the political settlement of hotspot issues such as the Iran nuclear issue, the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue and Syria. The UK hopes to enhance mutual support with China in hosting COP26 and COP15 respectively. Bilaterally, the mainstream of the UK society, especially the business community, hopes to deepen cooperation with China. China and the UK have highly complementary strengths and deeply integrated interests. There is a huge demand for cooperation in the areas of economy and trade, financial services, education, and science and technology.

A steady and sound China-UK relationship is not only in the interests of the peoples of both China and the UK, but also conducive to world peace and prosperity. We hope that the UK will return to an independent, reasonable and pragmatic policy on China, and stop going down the wrong path leading to self-defeat.

GT: There have been discussions about whether China should impose sanctions on British businesses in China, such as HSBC, AstraZeneca, GSK and Jaguar Land Rover. What is your opinion? Will the Shanghai-London Stock Connect and London's status as an overseas RMB trading center be affected?



Ambassador Liu: China remains committed to open and mutually-beneficial cooperation. We oppose politicizing economic issues and will continue to foster a fair, just, open and non-discriminatory business environment for foreign businesses. We think it is wrong for certain countries to abuse the concept of national security, violate the rules in international trade and exclude or suppress other countries or individual companies, and we are strongly opposed to this.

Business cooperation between China and the UK is based on a sound bilateral relationship. There are close connections and mutual influence between business cooperation and bilateral relationship. This is the reason why many people from the British business community have expressed their opposition to and concern over the recent words and deeds of the UK Government.

Recent years have seen remarkable progress in the financial cooperation between China and the UK, with London becoming the world's largest RMB offshore trading center and the second largest RMB offshore clearing center. The Shanghai-London Stock Connect links, for the first time, a Chinese and a major Western capital market. This bears great significance to both China and the UK. These achievements are not only reflections of the strength and status of London in international financial services. They have also benefited from the close relations between China and the UK. A steady bilateral relationship provides a solid foundation and guarantee for sound development of China-UK financial cooperation. Without this foundation, cooperation will be on shaky ground. It is our hope that the UK side will reflect on its recent remarks and moves with regard to China carefully and refrain from doing anything that undermines this very foundation.

GT: What, in your view, is the role of the US in the recent change of the UK's policy toward China? Do you think the UK has decided on whose side it will take in the rivalry between China and the US?


Ambassador Liu: The relationship between China and the US is at a critical juncture. China remains committed to working with the US to develop a relationship featuring no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. At the same time, China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests. It is our hope that the US will head toward the same direction as China, take vigorous efforts to implement the important agreements between the presidents of the two countries, and bring the bilateral relationship back on the track of coordination, cooperation and stability. The steady and sustained development of China-US relationship serves the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and meets the aspiration of the majority of the international community. China and the US stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Cooperation is the only right choice.

Multilateralism and globalization are the overriding trend of our times and international cooperation is the common aspiration of people of the world. In international relations, different sets of bilateral ties could exist and thrive side by side. It is bound to be unpopular for a certain country to cling to the ""zero-sum"" and ""Cold War"" mentality, incite division along ideological lines, form an exclusive coterie and force other countries to choose sides. This will not win people's heart. China has never sought to change or replace anyone. Nor has it asked other countries to choose sides between China and the US. China is committed to mutual respect, equal treatment and mutual benefit. It is our hope that the UK will stay independent in its foreign policy rather than dancing to the tune of the US. ""Great Britain"" cannot be ""Great"" without independent foreign policies.

GT: The US and the UK will sign a free trade agreement soon. What will be the impact on the business interactions between China and the UK? Do you find it necessary to re-consider a China-UK free trade agreement after Brexit?

Ambassador Liu: I do not think the free trade agreement between the US and the UK will have any impact on the business relations between China and the UK. China-UK trade and US-UK trade are different in development stage, structure and complementary strengths. China has a strong production capability in manufacturing, with a complete system of industrial categories. We also have a consumer market of 1.4 billion people. These are unique strengths found in no other places. Reaching free trade agreements with both China and the US will benefit not only the UK, but also China and the US. The two agreements will not pitch China and the US against each other nor make one's gain the other's loss.

With regard to the prospects of a free trade agreement between China and the UK, I think this depends, to some extent, on what policy the UK adopts toward China. The UK aims to build a ""global Britain"" after Brexit, but Britain wouldn't be ""global"" if it bypasses or excludes China, an important trading partner and an opportunity for future development. It is our hope that the UK will uphold the principles of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect, resist disruptions from other countries, and work with China to build closer China-UK business ties in the new era.

GT: Some British and US politicians and media claim that the Sino-British Joint Declaration is a ""legally-binding international treaty"" registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations, which cannot be terminated unilaterally, and that the UK has the responsibility to supervise the implementation of the Joint Declaration. How would you respond to this?



Ambassador Liu: Such claim reflects an ignorance of history. To help them brush up on the rudiments of history, I want to emphasize the following facts: The core of the Joint Declaration negotiated and signed between China and the UK is the resumption of China's exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. The basic policies regarding Hong Kong laid out in the Joint Declaration were proposed by China on our own initiative. They are not China's commitments to the UK or the so-called international obligations.

China's position on the Joint Declaration is consistent and clear. After the handover, the Chinese Government governs Hong Kong SAR in accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR, not the Joint Declaration. All the rights and obligations with regard to the UK side in the Joint Declaration have been fulfilled at the handover in 1997 when China resumed exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. The Joint Declaration has eight paragraphs with a total of 1,137 words and three annexes. Not a single word, paragraph or annex gives the UK any responsibility over Hong Kong after its handover. The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of ""supervision"" over Hong Kong after its handover. Therefore, the UK side should not use the Sino-British Joint Declaration as an excuse to make irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong and interfere in China's internal affairs.

GT: According to British media reports, Nathan Law, an anti-China element seeking to disrupt Hong Kong, and Simon Cheng, a former employee of the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong, are both in the UK and they are planning to use London as a base for the opposition forces from Hong Kong and even proposed the establishment of a ""Hong Kong parliament in exile"". What is your comment on this? If the UK Government allows such activities, how will China respond?



Ambassador Liu: As I said when giving an interview to a British media last month, it would be completely wrong if the UK permits the establishment of this so-called ""parliament in exile"", and this will create a new and serious obstacle for China-UK relationship. Such an organization would be an anti-China organization aimed at undermining ""One Country, Two Systems"", dividing China and promoting ""Hong Kong independence"". If this were allowed in the UK, the UK would seriously violate the basic norm governing international relations, that is, respect for other countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity. It will also damage China-UK mutual trust and undermine China-UK relationship.

I have urged the UK side, time and again, not to be bent on challenging China's sovereignty or supporting anti-China forces. Otherwise, China will resolutely strike back.

GT: Some Western countries, including the UK, have seen Hong Kong as an independent political and economic entity. The Chinese Embassy in the UK recently and repeatedly urged the relevant British politicians to recognize the fact that ""Hong Kong has been returned to China"". Where does the wrong perception of these British politicians on Hong Kong come from? How to promote a right understanding on China here in the UK?

Ambassador Liu: The world has entered the 21st century, but some politicians from Western countries, including the UK, have left their head in the Cold War years, or even the colonial era. They are locked in the Cold-War and colonial mindset, refuse to view China's development from an objective and reasonable perspective and harbor anxiety and misgivings about China. On the issue of Hong Kong, they do not want to recognize the fact that Hong Kong has been returned to China. Instead, they see themselves as the so-called ""supervisor"" and keep making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs. Recently, they hyped up ""China threat"", calling China a ""hostile"" or ""potentially hostile"" state, threatening a complete ""decoupling"" from China, and even clamouring for a ""new cold war"" against China. Such noise, although not representing the mainstream public opinion here in the UK, has created difficulties and disruptions to China-UK relationship.

I think this is due to two ""deficits"" in the UK's current China policy, namely, the ""understanding deficit"" and the ""trust deficit"". These are one of the root causes of the current difficulties in China-UK relationship. 

China and the UK differ in history, culture, social system and development stage. It is natural the two countries do not always see eye to eye. The key to reducing these ""deficits"" lies in closer contact and communication between the two countries. Only by advocating dialogue instead of confrontation and promoting closer links instead of decoupling can China and the UK enhance understanding, deepen mutual trust, manage and control differences and reduce the ""deficits"".

The UK government announced that the UK's mobile providers are banned from buying Huawei 5G equipment from the end of this year. In addition, the government requires operators to remove all Huawei equipment from the UK's telecommunications network by 2027. At the beginning of this year, the Johnson administration approved some limited involvement of Huawei in constructing UK's 5G network, now it reversed course.

This is certainly a blow to Huawei. UK's rejection of Huawei is likely to increase other countries' hesitation.

However, the UK government has given a buffer period, allowing mobile providers to stop buying Huawei equipment by the end of this year and remove Huawei equipment by 2027, indicating that banning Huawei is a difficult action for it. UK telecoms operators widely oppose the decision of banning Huawei and UK government officials have publicly acknowledged that the latest decision will delay the launch of 5G networks by two to three years and cost 2 billion pounds more.

UK's decision is obviously the result of heavy pressure from Washington. However, using Huawei or not is ultimately a matter of technology and economy. As long as Huawei can survive the US crackdown and maintain its technological lead, the decision of the UK will be only for now, and Huawei still has the chance for another comeback in the UK market.

Huawei's European rivals cannot compete with Huawei. The West may support them with administrative means, however, it will not help them become stronger. So Huawei should not feel discouraged. Growing under pressure is the only choice of Huawei.

The UK is an important member of the Five Eyes, which now follows Washington's policy loyally. The UK's decision means huge economic loss for it. It is highly doubtful that other European countries will make the same decision. 

Huawei's sales in the first half of this year increased by 13.1 percent year-on-year despite the epidemic. Some Western countries have been saying one thing on Huawei, but doing another. Even the US itself repeatedly approves certain contracts with Huawei. It's really not easy to say goodbye to Huawei.

It's necessary for China to retaliate against UK, otherwise wouldn't we be too easy to bully? Such retaliation should be public and painful for the UK. But it's unnecessary to turn it into a China-UK confrontation. The UK is not the US, nor Australia, nor Canada. It is a relative ""weak link"" in the Five Eyes. In the long run, the UK has no reason to turn against China, with the Hong Kong issue fading out.

China needs to speed up the development of its telecommunications technology. There will be many countries and many companies wavering under the pressure of the US. The most effective way for China to influence them will be to increase our strength and attractiveness, and nothing else.

Fate of Qing Dynasty offers some lessons for UK

Does the mind-set of today's Great Britain resemble that of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the last imperial dynasty of China? 

After the UK government announced a ban on Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network, British scholar Martin Jacques tweeted, ""History turns full circle. In 1793, Chinese Emperor Qianlong told the British King: 'We don't have the slightest need of your country's manufactures.' So marked the start of China's 150-year decline. In 2020, UK tells China that it has no need of China's latest technology.""

The remarks were quoted by Chinese Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming during his interview with BBC on Sunday. Liu added, ""I do not know what will happen in the next 150 years.""

What the UK faces now is somewhat similar to what the Qing Dynasty had faced. Any country with a splendid history might feel uncertain in the face of an emerging power. 

People who are familiar with the Qing Dynasty know the closed-door policy during the period well. When then British lord George Macartney led a mission in 1793 to visit Emperor Qianlong (1711-1799) of the Qing Dynasty and showed the latter a telescope, clocks and watches, models of artillery and warships, Qianlong described them as merely diabolical tricks and witchcraft. History soon witnessed how the dynasty declined due to its close-door policy. 

The most valuable lesson China has learned from that period is that a country must open up to advanced ideas, technologies and countries if it wishes to develop itself. Today's China is keeping its door wide open to the world, because it has suffered enough from remaining closed and self-fettered. 

Huawei has been operating in the UK for over 20 years, with its equipment and technologies being widely used in the country's 2G, 3G and 4G networks. Eliminating the company's role would thus be equivalent to ""self-harm"" of UK's telecoms networks, as some British observers believe.

Assembly Research, a London-based independent analyst firm, issued a report in 2019, claiming ""a partial, or full restriction on the use of Huawei could result in a delay to the 5G roll-out of between 18 and 24 months."" Some observers even claimed it would take a decade to entirely remove Huawei from UK's network currently in use. 

Certain British politicians believe the UK will be fine without the Chinese company. Sure, it will be all right, but the country will have to waste a few years to make up for the price paid in this geopolitical game, when other parts of the world are accelerating their pace in developing high technology in telecoms network. 

When Emperor Qianlong cast a cold eye to advanced technologies, he made the decision himself. But when London decided to ban Huawei, coercion from Washington could be sensed. 

The UK had its glorious days. Thanks to its pioneering spirit in science and technology, it became the world's first industrialized country. The prosperity of the British Empire was also closely linked to trade. Regrettably, UK's current high-tech agenda is dominated by the US. Would London sober up and make decisions for its best interests on its own? It's important to draw wisdom from history.

China has always been sincere to the UK. And it is hoped London can escape distractions when interacting with Beijing.

The UK's move to ban Huawei may further sour strained China-UK political ties, largely reduce personnel exchanges, and most likely prompt Beijing to take reciprocal measures against London's discriminatory policy, Chinese observers said.

The UK's mobile providers are being banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after December 31, and they must also remove all of the Chinese firm's 5G kits from their networks by 2027, the UK said on Tuesday, according to a BBC report.

New restrictions are also being applied to the use of the Chinese company's broadband kit. The UK government wants operators to ""transition away"" from purchasing new Huawei equipment for use in the full-fiber network, said BBC.

The UK government's decision to ban Huawei has led it into a quagmire that the country - which just exited the EU - can't emerge from in the next few years, Chinese analysts said.

""It will have very bad implications for the country. The UK will lag behind other major economies in utilizing the next-generation ultra-fast mobile technology, and potentially revolutionary new business models as well, to be enabled by Huawei's 5G,"" a Beijing-based industry analyst and a close follower of Huawei surnamed Li, told the Global Times on Tuesday.

""China will certainly retaliate against UK's discriminatory policy, and UK's trade ties with China will be hurt,"" Li said.

""China will closely watch the decision,"" Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a routine press conference on Tuesday. He noted that the move could be an ""indicator"" of whether it's safe for China to continue its investment in the UK. It could also serve as a touchstone of the market trend in the UK after the Brexit.

The decision also shows whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies in the country, Zhao warned.

The UK decided in January to let Huawei continue its role in the country's 5G network despite pressure from the US to crack down on the Chinese firm, but with restrictions. The company was excluded from providing ""core"" 5G gear.

Huawei could have been a positive driver for cooperation between China and the UK, but with the change of course, the bilateral relationship could worsen further. China, for a long time, may divert its political focus from the UK to the vast European continent, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday.   

UK's change of course and its back-and-forth attitude toward Huawei over the past months is driven by multiple reasons - intensified US pressure and the eagerness to maintain its massive untold interests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under China's national security law for Hong Kong, Cui said.

 ""Without Huawei as a 'buffer,' China could take a tougher stance and spare no feelings for the UK when dealing with the issues in the Hong Kong SAR,"" said Cui.

Nevertheless, as the UK is no longer an EU member, the decision won't have a major influence on other countries in Europe, and it will also not affect Huawei's cooperation with Europe, which is a much bigger market than Britain, Cui noted.

Major blow to UK economy

By excluding Huawei, the UK, which is already caught between Brexit woes and an economic setback amid the COVID-19 pandemic, could face major consequences that it may not be able to bear - from industrial impacts potentially costing millions of dollars to the harm done to China-UK ties, analysts said.

""Excluding Huawei's participation in the UK's next-generation networks means the country's telecommunications sector would suffer unbearable losses, and the extra costs would shift to consumers,"" said Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst.

Huawei said the UK ban on its 5G involvement is disappointing, and the decision is a bad news for anyone in the UK with mobile phone. ""Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicized, this is about US trade policy and not security.""

It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide. Instead of 'leveling up,' the government is leveling down and we urge them to reconsider, Huawei said.

Andy Purdy, Chief Security Officer of Huawei, has urged the US government and the Chinese government to hold discussions about the Chinese tech giant, after the UK banned the company from its 5G network. “I think escalation in these situations is a huge mistake,” he said. 

Purdy told the Global Times that US officials would ""apparently not” be willing to hold talks with their Chinese counterparts. “Now it's a campaign issue on top of everything else,"" he said.

Ma told the Global Times on Tuesday that such a tough stance against Huawei shows the UK government can sacrifice its own 5G development and local operators' business interests just for political reasons, by taking aim at a Chinese company that has nothing to do with politics.

Analysts noted more UK firms are set to be sacrificed for the UK's political stance. For instance, HSBC, the London-headquartered multinational bank, has been the latest scapegoat - being blamed by UK politicians for its support for the national security law for Hong Kong, and faced with growing controversy over the legal battle with Huawei, the firm has been under tremendous pressure in recent days.

With the UK's ban on Huawei, the London-based lender may now face a worsening dilemma, where it's already far from safety regarding reprisals, said insiders, noting that HSBC should be more concerned about its situation than Huawei.

For Huawei, confidence in its 5G gear expansion in overseas markets would not be heavily influenced, according to Ma, which can be insinuated by the timing the unlisted Chinese firm released its semi-annual earnings one day prior to the announcement of the UK's decision.

Huawei regularly released such reports at month's end. 

""The decision has also impacted upon the UK's independent diplomacy, as it bows more to US pressure to crack down on Huawei,"" Ma noted.

Huawei posted revenue of 454 billion ($64.88 billion) in the first half of 2020, a 13.1 percent increase year-on-year, with a net profit margin of 9.2 percent, a hard-won feat that beat forecasts amid the pandemic and an intensified US crackdown campaign.

Huawei's carriers, enterprises, and consumer businesses had revenue of 159.6 billion yuan, 36.3 billion yuan, and 255.8 billion yuan respectively, all recording slight growth compared to the same period last year.

""Huawei has promised to continue fulfilling its obligations to customers and suppliers, and to survive, forge ahead, and contribute to the global digital economy and technological development, no matter what future challenges the company faces,"" the firm said.",,,,,,,,,london huawei decision turning point chinauk tie analyst shen weiduo zhang hongpei published jul pm updated jul pm photo vcg

　　Huawei released its 2020 semi-annual report late at night on July 13. On July 14, the UK announced a ban on Huawei equipment. However, it is gratifying that despite the raging epidemic, Huawei's sales revenue still achieved a growth of 13.1% in the first half of 2020. Facing the more uncertain second half of the year, Huawei needs to continue to enhance its independent research and development capabilities while maintaining its strong performance in the domestic market, and strive to reduce its technological dependence on other countries.

　　Second quarter performance rebounded sharply

　　Huawei's 2020 semi-annual report shows that the company achieved sales revenue of 454 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 13.1%, and a net profit margin of 9.2%. Among them, consumer business revenue was 255.8 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 15.85%.

　　Compared with the 2019 semi-annual report, Huawei's revenue growth has slowed down significantly, but its net profit margin has increased. Data shows that Huawei's revenue in the first half of 2019 was 401.3 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 23.2%, and its net profit margin was 8.7%.

　　Based on the performance calculations in the first quarter of this year, Huawei's operating conditions have significantly recovered after entering the second quarter. Huawei's sales revenue in the first quarter was 182.2 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of only 1.4%, but in the second quarter, sales revenue reached 271.8 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 22.65%.

　　""In the first quarter of this year, the global smartphone market experienced its worst decline in history. In the second quarter, the domestic epidemic gradually improved, production returned to normal, and consumer demand increased. Not only Huawei, but the entire mobile phone market rebounded."" Sankei Observer Major General Ding pointed out.

　　Telecommunications analyst Ma Jihua believes that judging from Huawei's semi-annual report, in such a difficult first half of 2020, Huawei still achieved good growth. Both revenue and profits basically maintained a growth rate similar to last year, which fully demonstrates that This has enhanced Huawei’s development resilience.

　　Huawei stated in its semi-annual report that in the face of a complex external environment, open cooperation and mutual trust in the global industrial chain have become increasingly important. ""No matter what difficulties we encounter, Huawei will be committed to fulfilling its obligations to customers and suppliers, continue to work hard to survive and move forward, and contribute to the development of the global digital economy and technology.""

　　Consumer business remains strong

　　As Huawei's supporting department, the consumer business is still the company's largest source of revenue, with revenue of 255.8 billion yuan accounting for 56.63% of the overall revenue. In 2019, the consumer business accounted for 56.63% of the overall revenue. The ratio is 54.4%.

　　In the domestic market, Chinese consumers have given Huawei the greatest support. According to IDC's first quarter domestic mobile phone shipment report, in the first quarter of this year, China's smartphone market shipped approximately 66.6 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 20.3%. Huawei shipped 28.4 million units in the first quarter, ranking first, with a market share of The same period last year increased from 35.5% to 42.6%.

　　In the global market, Huawei has surpassed Samsung to become the number one manufacturer in terms of shipments. A report released by market research organization Counterpoint shows that global smartphone shipments in April were 69.37 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 41%. Among them, Samsung mobile phone market share was approximately 19.1%, and Huawei reached 21.4%. For the first time Surpassing Samsung; Global smartphone market shipments in May were 81.97 million units, and Huawei once again surpassed Samsung with a market share of 19.7% to become the world's number one.

　　It should be noted that Huawei has been greatly affected in the European market due to the inability to carry Google applications. The European smartphone market shrank by 7% in the first quarter of 2020. Among the top four brands, Samsung and Apple fell by 23% and 13% respectively. Huawei suffered the largest year-on-year decline, falling by 43%.

　　""Whether Huawei's mobile phone business will grow in the second half of this year depends on two factors,"" Major General Ding emphasized. First, whether the domestic market can continue to increase its market share. At present, this trend is obvious, and it may rise to 50%. ; In addition, whether it is self-developed or outsourced, as long as the supply chain is basically stable, the mobile phone business will maintain steady growth. Ma Jihua believes that from a full-year perspective, 5G mobile phones will benefit from users delaying replacement, which is not necessarily a bad thing for Huawei.

　　External challenges cannot be ignored

　　However, Huawei cannot control the market restrictions caused by international factors and can only rely on its own efforts to improve the supply chain.

　　In terms of operator business, according to foreign media reports, on the evening of July 14, British Culture Secretary Dowden announced that the UK has decided to stop using Huawei equipment in 5G construction. Dowden said that the British government will stop purchasing new Huawei equipment from December 31, 2020. In addition, Huawei equipment currently used in the UK's 5G network must be removed by 2027.

　　In this regard, Huawei UK spokesman Edward Brewster said: ""This is bad news for all mobile phone users in the UK. This may cause the UK to fall into the slow lane of digital development, increase consumer communication expenditures, and deepen the digital The gap. Far from 'improving', this move will reduce the UK's development level. It is a pity that Huawei's future development in the UK has been politicized. This move stems from US trade policy, not security concerns.""

　　In the afternoon of the same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian stated that whether an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment can be provided for Chinese companies in the UK is a litmus test for the direction of the British market after Brexit, and whether it is safe for Chinese investments in the UK. China will pay close attention to the trend.

　　A reporter from Beijing Business Daily contacted Huawei for an interview. As of press time, the other party had not responded.

　　In Ma Jihua's view, if this news is true, then Huawei's late-night financial report is tantamount to a statement. Huawei has demonstrated its strong growth capabilities, its ability to not be afraid of any sanctions and restrictions, and its strength in the field of communications technology. Breaking with Huawei is tantamount to parting ways with the mainstream communications industry. Judging from the number of 5G standard essential patents, Huawei, ZTE, OPPO and China Academy of Information and Communications Technology currently have the number of patents among the top 12 in the world. Among them, Huawei has 3,147 5G standard essential patents, ranking first in the world.

　　In terms of consumer business, due to a statement from the U.S. Department of Commerce in May this year, Huawei may lose the opportunity to have chips manufactured by TSMC. This statement comprehensively restricts Huawei from purchasing semiconductors produced using American software and technology, including those production equipment located outside the United States but included in the U.S. business control list. Before it can produce OEMs for Huawei and HiSilicon, it needs to obtain approval from the U.S. government. license.

　　""For Huawei, on the one hand, it must continue to consolidate its leading advantage in the domestic market and use the strong performance of the domestic market to buy time for normal operations in overseas markets; on the other hand, it must continue to increase its research and development efforts, expand its leading advantage in 5G technology, and strive for Use overwhelming technological advantages to win opportunities for equal cooperation. In addition, the supply chain also needs to integrate resources from all parties at home and abroad to strive for inventory, backup, and buffering, so as to promote win-win cooperation in the industrial chain and enhance independent capabilities.

Digital secretary says he is setting ‘clear path for complete removal of high risk vendors’ from 5G networks

Telecoms providers must stop installing Huawei equipment in the UK’s 5G networks from next September, the government has said.

The digital secretary, Oliver Dowden, set out a roadmap to remove high-risk vendors ahead of the telecommunications (security) bill coming before parliament.

The legislation would create national security powers capable of imposing controls on when – if at all – a telecoms firm could use material supplied by companies such as Huawei.

In the summer, the government announced that the Chinese firm was to be banned from the most sensitive core parts of UK networks.

It also said it plans to rip out all Huawei equipment from 5G networks by 2027 – decisions that would be enshrined in law by the new bill.

But Dowden has now confirmed that operators must stop installing Huawei equipment in 5G networks from the end of September next year, except for maintaining previously-installed Huawei equipment.

He also published a 5G Supply Chain Diversification Strategy outlining how the government will ensure the UK is “never again dependent on a handful of telecoms vendors”.

Dowden said: “Today I am setting out a clear path for the complete removal of high-risk vendors from our 5G networks.

“This will be done through new and unprecedented powers to identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security.

“We are also publishing a new strategy to make sure we are never again dependent on a handful of telecoms vendors for the smooth and secure running of our networks.

“Our plans will spark a wave of innovation in the design of our future mobile networks.”

The diversification strategy will see the government spend an initial £250m to begin work on creating a more diverse, competitive and innovative supply market for telecoms.

It includes establishing a National Telecoms Lab research facility, as well as investment in innovative open radio technology.

MPs will debate the bill at second reading in the Commons on Tuesday.

Under the legislation, security protocols around UK networks will also be strengthened with fines – of 10% of turnover or £100,000 a day – for those who do not meet the new standards.

Communications regulator Ofcom is to be tasked with the monitoring and assessing of security protocols among telecoms providers.

‘Geopolitical’ factors were behind the move, the company was told, with hints that the decision could be reversed in future

The British government privately told the Chinese technology giant Huawei that it was being banned from Britain’s 5G telecoms network partly for “geopolitical” reasons following huge pressure from President Donald Trump, the Observer has learned.

In the days leading up to the controversial announcement on Tuesday last week, intensive discussions were held and confidential communications exchanged between the government and Whitehall officials on one side and Huawei executives on the other.

As part of the high-level behind-the-scenes contacts, Huawei was told that geopolitics had played a part, and was given the impression that it was possible the decision could be revisited in future, perhaps if Trump failed to win a second term and the anti-China stance in Washington eased.

Senior Huawei executives have gone public since Tuesday’s decision saying that they hope the British government will rethink, apparently encouraged by the results of back-channel contacts.

The government’s private admissions are out of kilter with public statements last week by ministers, who said Huawei had been banned because of new security concerns raised by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is part of GCHQ.

In the Commons, Oliver Dowden, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said new sanctions forbidding the sale of US-produced components to Huawei – meaning the Chinese company will have to source them from elsewhere – had changed the balance of security risk.

“The new US measures restrict Huawei’s ability to produce important products using US technology or software,” he said. “The National Cyber Security Centre has reviewed the consequences of the US’s actions …

“The NCSC has now reported to ministers that they have significantly changed their security assessment of Huawei’s presence in the UK 5G network. Given the uncertainty this creates around Huawei’s supply chain, the UK can no longer be confident it will be able to guarantee the security of future Huawei 5G equipment affected by the change in the US foreign direct product rules.”

Last week’s move reversed a decision made in January when the government announced that Huawei equipment could be used in its new 5G network on a restricted basis. This led to fierce criticism from Tory MPs, including former party leader Iain Duncan Smith, who described Huawei as an arm of the Chinese Communist party and a risk to the UK.

Tuesday’s reversal of that announcement pleased all but the most hardline anti-Huawei Tory MPs. But it has called into question Boris Johnson’s manifesto promise to supply superfast broadband to every home and business across the country by 2025, and led the Chinese to warn of retaliation. However, Beijing’s response was more muted than many on the UK side had feared.

The decision has also led to accusations that the UK government is putting its loyalty to Trump – who is waging a diplomatic war against China over coronavirus, human rights, trade, its stance on Hong Kong, and Huawei in the run-up to the US presidential elections – before its commitment to put the UK in the vanguard of global technological advances.

In a press conference at the White House on Tuesday, Trump immediately claimed credit for the UK decision – “I did this myself, for the most part” – and said he was trying to force other nations not to use Huawei.

Rejecting claims that the UK government was kowtowing to Trump because of the UK’s need to sign a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, dismissed the president’s claim. “We all know Donald Trump, don’t we,” he told Sky News. “But I think this is a sensible decision. All sorts of people can try to claim credit for the decision but this was based on a technical assessment by the National Cyber Security Centre about how we can have the highest quality 5G systems in the future.”

Lord O’Neill, the economist who was brought into the government as commercial secretary to the Treasury in 2015, said the private explanations given to Huawei made the decision seem “more rational”.

He said: “Given that the prime minister continues to describe himself as a Sinophile, one would think that he is trying to minimise the damage. Otherwise, the decision does not make any sense whatsoever. China has been the biggest contributor to global GDP in the last 20 years. So why would we want to cut ourselves off from that?”

However, Tory MPs will be infuriated by any suggestion that there could be another U-turn on Huawei. Several have vowed to push Johnson further to ban Huawei from the UK altogether, including from existing 2G, 3G and 4G networks.

The Labour MP Kevan Jones, a former defence minister who now serves on the Commons intelligence and security committee, said it was clear US pressure had swayed the government. “Of course security should be the number one priority, but it is clear this decision was taken for geopolitical reasons rather than taking into account the economic costs to the UK,” he said.

This week the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, will visit London and hold talks with Tory MPs, including Duncan Smith, who are opposed to Huawei. He is expected to try lobby other European governments on his visit.

Huawei refused to comment on its talks with civil servants and ministers and pointed to a statement issued last week saying: “This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide. Instead of ‘levelling up’ the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider. We remain confident that the new US restrictions would not have affected the resilience or security of the products we supply to the UK.”

A DCMS spokesperson said: “We have banned the purchase of any new 5G Huawei equipment after 31 December this year, and will remove all Huawei equipment from 5G networks by the end of 2027.

“This was a decision taken by ministers at the National Security Council, based on technical, security analysis from the world-leading National Cyber Security Centre.”

The Guardian has spent the past 13 years tirelessly investigating the shortcomings of the Tories in office – austerity, Brexit, partygate, cronyism, the Truss debacle and the individual failings of ministers who behave as if the rules don’t apply to them.

Spokeswoman voices fears over openness of UK market after MPs say Huawei is security risk

China has said it is highly concerned about the future openness and safety of Chinese investments in the UK after the Commons defence select committee said the presence of Huawei in UK 5G networks represented “a significant risk to individuals and government”.

The committee also dismissed claims by Huawei that it was independent from the Chinese Communist party.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said in response to the report that some in the UK should think before they speak and that the legitimate interests of Chinese companies were being damaged.

“The openness and fairness of the UK market, as well as the security of foreign investments there, is highly concerning,” she said, speaking at a daily news conference in Beijing on Friday.

Huawei responded to the report by saying it lacked credibility. “It is built on opinion rather than fact. We’re sure people will see through these groundless accusations of collusion and remember instead what Huawei has delivered for Britain over the past 20 years,” a company spokesman said.

The Chinese foreign ministry reaction, although in line with other recent criticism of UK policy towards China, underlines the risks British and Chinese firms face as they seek to trade in each other’s markets.

The MPs had admitted that “ending China’s involvement in the UK’s critical infrastructure would be a radical step with huge implications for the UK’s economy”, but they also warned that “if threats by the Chinese state continue and worsen, the government should carefully consider China’s future presence in critical sectors of the economy”.

The latest comments from China are likely to add to calls for the government to use the imminent national security and investment bill to take wider powers to block new or existing foreign investments that threaten Britain’s national interest.

Chinese investments in the nuclear industry and potentially HS2 are judged to be the most controversial.

The Chinese reaction comes despite the select committee holding back from assessing Huawei’s presence in UK 5G as a major risk. The MPs point out the UK government’s cyber experts had been clear that the original UK plan, set out in January 2020 but subsequently abandoned under US pressure in July, to restrict Huawei to 35% of the market had been correct.

The MPs also found there was no risk of Huawei being able to access UK intelligence communications through its access to 5G.

The committee said the UK ministers had in effect been forced to change their position to a complete removal of Huawei by 2027 mainly due to the US decision in May to ban the use of reliable US chips in the Huawei network. That meant Huawei 5G in turn was no longer as reliable.

“From our public and private conversations with the government,” the MPs reported, “we were confident that GCHQ and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) were able to appropriately manage any increased risk posed by the presence of Huawei or other high-risk vendors in the UK’s 5G. Furthermore, we recognised that whilst the risk remained manageable, it was important to remember the benefits in having a greater number of vendors involved in 5G network provision.”

The NCSC told the committee there was no technical reason for the UK’s close intelligence allies – the US and Australia – to ban Huawei outright, leading the MPs to conclude that steps had been taken for geopolitical reasons.

The MPs also warned of blackouts across the network if the government tried to speed up the Huawei phaseout to a date as early as 2025.

In one of the most damning passages of the report, the committee said Huawei “is clearly strongly linked to the Chinese state and the Chinese Communist party, despite its statements to the contrary, as evidenced by its ownership model and the subsidies it has received. Additionally, Huawei’s apparent willingness to support China’s intelligence agencies and China’s 2017 national intelligence law are further cause for concern.”

The MPs also expressed concern that the recent discussions about UK allies cooperating to form an alternative to Huawei remained hazy, pointing out that the ejection of Huawei would leave the UK with a three-company vendor market, which presents a resilience risk of its own. They said one of the three firms still active in the UK market – the Swedish firm Ericsson – was highly dependent on Chinese products.",,,,,,,,,china say highly concerned safety uk investment article year old spokeswoman voice fear openness uk market mp say huawei security risk patrick wintour diplomatic editor fri oct bst share china said highly concerned future openness safety chinese investment uk common defence select committee said presence huawei uk g network represented significant risk individual government committee also dismissed claim huawei independent chinese communist party chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said response report uk think speak legitimate interest chinese company damaged openness fairness uk market well security foreign investment highly concerning said speaking daily news conference beijing friday huawei responded report saying lacked credibility built opinion rather fact sure people see groundless accusation collusion remember instead huawei delivered britain past year company spokesman said qa huawei role g controversial show chinese foreign ministry reaction although line recent criticism uk policy towards china underline risk british chinese firm face seek trade others market mp admitted ending china involvement uk critical infrastructure would radical step huge implication uk economy also warned threat chinese state continue worsen government carefully consider china future presence critical sector economy latest comment china likely add call government use imminent national security investment bill take wider power block new existing foreign investment threaten britain national interest chinese investment nuclear industry potentially h judged controversial chinese reaction come despite select committee holding back assessing huaweis presence uk g major risk mp point uk government cyber expert clear original uk plan set january subsequently abandoned u pressure july restrict huawei market correct mp also found risk huawei able access uk intelligence communication access g committee said uk minister effect forced change position complete removal huawei mainly due u decision may ban use reliable u chip huawei network meant huawei g turn longer reliable public private conversation government mp reported confident gchq national cyber security centre ncsc able appropriately manage increased risk posed presence huawei highrisk vendor uk g furthermore recognised whilst risk remained manageable important remember benefit greater number vendor involved g network provision ncsc told committee technical reason uk close intelligence ally u australia ban huawei outright leading mp conclude step taken geopolitical reason mp also warned blackout across network government tried speed huawei phaseout date early one damning passage report committee said huawei clearly strongly linked chinese state chinese communist party despite statement contrary evidenced ownership model subsidy received additionally huaweis apparent willingness support china intelligence agency china national intelligence law cause concern mp also expressed concern recent discussion uk ally cooperating form alternative huawei remained hazy pointing ejection huawei would leave uk threecompany vendor market present resilience risk said one three firm still active uk market swedish firm ericsson highly dependent chinese product

Regulator Ofcom under growing pressure to block state-backed station for its broadcast of forced confessions

Michael Savage Policy Editor

Britain’s broadcasting regulator is under mounting pressure to bar China’s state-owned TV channel from the UK’s airwaves after accusations that it has repeatedly breached impartiality rules and aired forced confessions.

There are currently three live investigations under way by Ofcom into China Global Television Network (CGTN), the country’s English-language news channel. The regulator has already ruled against the channel earlier this month, for airing a forced confession by the former British journalist Peter Humphrey. Labour is to raise alleged repeated breaches by the channel with Ofcom’s chief executive Melanie Dawes.

Ofcom has also received a complaint stating that CGTN should not be allowed to broadcast at all because it is effectively controlled by a political party. Human rights group Safeguard Defenders submitted its complaint earlier this year. Peter Dahlin, its director, said: “The best way forward is to revoke their licence to teach them that this is unacceptable. And then of course they can, according to the rules, reapply for a licence after that and restart the process.”

It comes amid increased tension with China, following Britain’s decision to strip equipment made by Chinese company Huawei out of the country’s phone networks by 2027. The decision came after a mounting backlash among Tory MPs about the company’s involvement in the 5G network. That decision led Chinese state media to warn of a “public and painful” retaliation. The state-run Global Times said in an editorial that China could not “remain passive”.

Ofcom has an ongoing duty to make sure those that hold a licence to broadcast in this country are fit and proper
Jo Stevens, shadow culture secretary
CGTN is available on several UK platforms, with programmes produced around the world. It does not publish viewing figures, but has recruited a number of western journalists, including former BBC reporters, to boost its European output. Its increased European presence included opening a production base in London last year. It already has a US offshoot, where it has been registered as an agent representing the interests of a foreign power.

Complaints submitted to Ofcom about CGTN include one from Simon Cheng, a former employee of the UK’s consulate in Hong Kong. He alleges CGTN broadcast his forced confession. He was detained during a trip to China in August and says he was made to confess to soliciting prostitution.

Another complaint came from the daughter of a detainee. Angela Gui, the daughter of Hong Kong bookseller Gui Minhai, who disappeared in 2015, said the channel broadcast forced confessions from her father. He was released, but rearrested in 2018 and is still detained in China.

Jo Stevens, the shadow culture secretary, said: “The findings against CGTN are damning and Ofcom have already said they will take action which could go as far as banning the channel from the UK airwaves. Ofcom has an ongoing duty to make sure those that hold a licence to broadcast in this country are fit and proper.

“All too often TV channels run by foreign states, such as Russia Today and the Iranian Press TV, which was banned in 2012, have found themselves unable to abide by the broadcasting code. CGTN and other state-backed broadcasters have a history of flagrantly breaching the Ofcom code. While the regulator can and does impose financial penalties, these are less of a deterrent than for other TV channels. There needs to be a review of whether the current sanction regime is sufficient.”

While there are calls to have its licence revoked, other senior MPs, such as former first secretary of state Damian Green, say that banning it should be a “last resort”.

Humphrey, who has a second complaint against CGTN lodged with Ofcom, said: “I hope that by the cancelling of that licence, our people in the UK will never again have to be subjected to viewing that form of abusive propaganda material, of people ‘confessing’ in cages.”

CGTN was contacted for comment, but had not replied by the time of publication. Stations found to have violated the broadcasting code are usually fined in the first instance, but there is precedent for revoking a licence. Press TV, the Iranian English-language station, lost its licence in 2012.",,,,,,,,,china tv channel face uk ban complaint mount article year old regulator ofcom growing pressure block statebacked station broadcast forced confession michael savage policy editor sun jul bst share britain broadcasting regulator mounting pressure bar china stateowned tv channel uk airwave accusation repeatedly breached impartiality rule aired forced confession currently three live investigation way ofcom china global television network cgtn country englishlanguage news channel regulator already ruled channel earlier month airing forced confession former british journalist peter humphrey labour raise alleged repeated breach channel ofcoms chief executive melanie dawes ofcom also received complaint stating cgtn allowed broadcast effectively controlled political party human right group safeguard defender submitted complaint earlier year peter dahlin director said best way forward revoke licence teach unacceptable course according rule reapply licence restart process come amid increased tension china following britain decision strip equipment made chinese company huawei country phone network decision came mounting backlash among tory mp company involvement g network decision led chinese state medium warn public painful retaliation staterun global time said editorial china could remain passive ofcom ongoing duty make sure hold licence broadcast country fit proper jo stevens shadow culture secretary cgtn available several uk platform programme produced around world publish viewing figure recruited number western journalist including former bbc reporter boost european output increased european presence included opening production base london last year already u offshoot registered agent representing interest foreign power complaint submitted ofcom cgtn include one simon cheng former employee uk consulate hong kong alleges cgtn broadcast forced confession detained trip china august say made confess soliciting prostitution another complaint came daughter detainee angela gui daughter hong kong bookseller gui minhai disappeared said channel broadcast forced confession father released rearrested still detained china jo stevens shadow culture secretary said finding cgtn damning ofcom already said take action could go far banning channel uk airwave ofcom ongoing duty make sure hold licence broadcast country fit proper often tv channel run foreign state russia today iranian press tv banned found unable abide broadcasting code cgtn statebacked broadcaster history flagrantly breaching ofcom code regulator impose financial penalty le deterrent tv channel need review whether current sanction regime sufficient tory mp damian green tv news programme view image fullscreen tory mp damian green say banning cgtn last resort photograph jonathan hordlerexshutterstock call licence revoked senior mp former first secretary state damian green say banning last resort humphrey second complaint cgtn lodged ofcom said hope cancelling licence people uk never subjected viewing form abusive propaganda material people confessing cage cgtn contacted comment replied time publication station found violated broadcasting code usually fined first instance precedent revoking licence press tv iranian englishlanguage station lost licence

Global Times mouthpiece says Beijing must respond or be seen as ‘easy to bully’

Chinese state media has foreshadowed “public and painful” retaliation against the UK over its ban of Huawei from the country’s 5G networks, as Donald Trump appeared to take credit for the decision.

Following Britain’s announcement that Huawei would be stripped out of the country’s phone networks by 2027, the state-run Global Times said in an editorial that China could not “remain passive”.

“It is necessary for China to retaliate against the UK, otherwise would we not be seen as easy to bully. Such retaliation should be public and painful for the UK,” the article said.

Ties between the UK and China have deteriorated over the past month as the UK has criticised Beijing’s imposition of a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong, a former British colony, and pledged to support fleeing pro-democracy activists and protesters. China has said it will take firm “countermeasures” in response.

Yet Chinese officials also appear to be making an effort not to escalate UK-China tensions, by blaming measures like the Huawei ban on US pressure. Earlier this month, China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said that any ban of Huawei would tarnish the UK’s reputation as independent from the US.

On Tuesday, Liu tweeted that the decision was “disappointing and wrong”. On Wednesday a foreign ministry spokeswoman said China strongly opposed the decision and said it was driven by the politicisation of commercial and technological issues and not by national security.

The Global Times editorial says: “It is not necessary to turn this into a China-UK confrontation. The UK is not the US, nor Australia, nor Canada. It is a relative ‘weak link’ in the Five Eyes. In the long run the UK has no reason to turn against China, with the Hong Kong issue fading out.”

The Global Times’ editor, Hu Xijin, tweeted that political conditions could change before the deadline: “UK can only completely remove Huawei by 2027, which indicates it’s difficult to leave Huawei. But there could be change before and after that.”

The US president claimed credit for the UK move, boasting in a press conference that no White House “has been tougher on China” than his administration.

“I did this myself, for the most part,” he said as he spoke of having worked to pressure countries to not use Huawei, adding: “If they want to do business with us, they can’t use it.

“We convinced many countries - many countries - and I did this myself, for the most part, not to use Huawei because we think it’s an unsafe security risk. It’s a big security risk,” he said.

Boris Johnson’s new press chief believed to have been trying to stop Chinese firm from being dropped from UK’s 5G network

Boris Johnson’s new communications director lobbied a former chief of staff at Downing Street not to ban Chinese technology company Huawei over spying fears, leaked documents suggest.

Guto Harri, who was appointed No 10’s press chief on Monday in the wake of the partygate resignations, reportedly asked Sir Eddie Lister which ministers he could “nudge” for help.

He met Lister, who was then the prime minister’s chief of staff, as well as three top executives from the technology firm Huawei, which has links with the ruling Chinese Communist party, on 2 June 2020, according to the Sun.

The paper said that Harri, representing lobbying firm Hawthorn Advisors, used the 25-minute video call to ask which ministers to approach at a time when the security service was reviewing the risk of allowing the firm into the UK’s core telecommunications network.

He asked Lister if there were “any ­ministers we should talk to? Perhaps give a nudge in DCMS [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport] or Treasury?”.

The paper said that, according to minutes taken at the time, the No 10 chief of staff suggested Johnson did not want to ban Huawei but was “caught” between pressure from the Tory party and the US government.

He said: “This PM is not anti-China and is not Donald Trump,” adding that Johnson “believes in good relationships with China. He is not coming from a negative place in any way.”

He added: “We are caught. We want the technology, we want it rolled out. There’s an American concern and a parliamentary concern. There are a large number of MPs across the political divide who have a problem with China. Some are Atlanticists, some over Covid, some over Hong Kong, some over human rights.”

No 10 defended Harri’s appointment by Johnson on Sunday when his links with Huawei were first reported and said full security checks had been concluded.

However, the former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith joined Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings in calling for further investigation into Harri’s appointment.

He said: “Given the issue of the threat to national security that Huawei poses, that lay behind why Huawei have been banned from our 5G system, it is important that there is clarity in these matters.

“Will Guto Harri now be subject to full security oversight including past involvements with Huawei?”

A No 10 spokesperson told the Sun: “In full compliance with appropriate guidance, government officials met with a number of interested parties, including Huawei, following the change in US policy.”

Ambassador’s warning comes in response to UK’s special visa offer to Hong Kong citizens

China will not recognise the British national (overseas) passport as a legal travel document, raising the prospect that the 3 million Hong Kong citizens eligible for the passport will be banned from leaving Hong Kong by the Chinese government.

The warning was made at a press conference by the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, in which he also warned that it was hard to imagine a global Britain that bypassed or excluded China. Decoupling from China would mean decoupling from growth and the future, he suggested.

UK-China relations have headed into deep freeze after the UK banned the China state-backed Huawei from UK 5G technology and then protested over the introduction of new security laws in Hong Kong, a former British colony.

Liu punctuated his online press conference with videos seeking to debunk reports that Uighur Muslims have been suppressed in Xinjiang province, saying those sent to re-education centres, which he claimed were akin to boarding schools, were only going through the same kind of anti-radicalisation training as terrorists in the west.

He said it was the UK, and not China, that had changed, and should take full responsibility for the current difficulties in the relationship. He blamed cold-war warriors in the Conservative party, and said they were influenced by outside powers. The UK and China should have the wisdom not to allow anti-China forces and cold-war warriors to kidnap the relationship, he said. Great Britain, he argued, “cannot be great if it does not have independent foreign policies”.

The ambassador was reluctant to be drawn on the practical implications of refusing to recognise the BNO passport as a valid travel document, but said the move was a response to the UK’s decision to offer a right for all those eligible for a BNO passport to seek a path to citizenship in the UK.

He said the offer breached the 1984 Memorandum of Agreement that promised the UK would not provide a permanent right of abode to BNO passport-holders. “Since the UK have violated their commitment, we have to let them know that we have to take measures not to recognise the BNO passport as a valid travel document,” he said.

The refusal to recognise the BNO passport in theory raises the prospect of tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens being trapped in the city or being refused re-entry if they leave the country and try to return, although there was some confusion over the practical impact of the policy, since Hong Kong residents say they can leave and re-enter Hong Kong without showing a BNO passport. An ID card is normally sufficient to pass through immigration.

He also urged British politicians not to follow up the Huawei decision by forcing China out of the French-led nuclear project Hinkley Point C, saying the project would allow the UK to meet its commitment to reach zero-carbon emissions by 2050.

His press conference came alongside an article in the South China Morning Post that he said no British newspaper would publish, threatening to withdraw several billions in investment following the government’s decision to ban Huawei’s products from 5G mobile networks.

Liu wrote: “In 2018, the company announced a further investment plan of £3bn in the next five years, which is a positive vote for growth in Britain. Unfortunately, this will now be subject to uncertainties in light of the British government’s recent decision.”

He also suggested the UK decision meant the UK may miss out on the “development bonus” of China, the world’s fastest-growing economy.

Liu, the ambassador in the UK for a decade, also defended the disqualification of 12 pro-democracy candidates from this autumn’s legislative elections in Hong Kong, saying the new security laws had nothing to do with free speech and targeted a few criminals.

He repeatedly said China had no desire to export its model, promising: “We do not want to threaten, challenge or replace anyone.” He insisted: “China threatens no one. We just let you know the consequences. China wants to be a friend of the UK and a UK partner, but if you do not want to be a partner and our friend, and you want to treat China as a hostile power, you will pay the price.

Boris Johnson is driving change of approach despite party voices campaigning on Uyghur genocide

Conservative MPs have warned of a parliamentary backlash following steps taken by the government to ease tensions with China, designed to pave the way for better trading relations.

Over the past few weeks, Boris Johnson has quietly signalled a thaw in frosty relations since the decision in 2020 to exclude Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from the UK’s 5G network.

His communications chief, Guto Harri, is a former spinner for Huawei, though his previous chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, had also been an advocate of mending relations.

The prime minister has ordered a restart of the UK-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission [Jetco] and this year Rishi Sunak is understood to be on the verge of agreeing the return of annual trade summit, the 11th UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD), which has not been held since 2019.

“The Treasury cannot shake the orthodoxy that we must have better trading terms with China,” one senior source said. “But it is Downing Street who really wants this. Boris has always been uneasy about having to cancel Huawei.”

The EFD has previously been used to announce lucrative commercial contracts and closer trade cooperation but a Treasury source played down the significance of the return of the EFD, “if it goes ahead at all”, and said it would be a chance for dialogue rather that leading to any major changes.

The source said it was wrong to portray Sunak as the driving force. “It’s the chancellor’s view that our principles should guide our relationship with China. We need to be eyes wide open about their increasing international influence and must take a principled stand on issues that conflict with our own values.”

The move to defrost relations with Beijing is understood to be a source of tension between Johnson and his foreign secretary, Liz Truss. “Liz is a proper China hawk,” another senior government source said. Truss is scheduled to meet the delegation of MPs who were banned from China for lobbying for sanctions to oppose the Uyghur genocide in the coming days.

The UK’s trade deficit with China has more than tripled in the last year, importing £40.5bn more from China than it exported to the country.

Any significant change of approach threatens to reopen splits with backbenchers, especially those who have been blacklisted by Beijing and who are understood to feel they have received no tangible support from government, including on crucial issues like cybersecurity.

Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former cabinet minister, said it “beggars belief that we are about to re-invent the failed project kowtow” and blamed the Treasury and Downing Street for an overeagerness to normalise relations. “Whether it is the CCP’s illegal seizure and militarisation of the South China seas or the trashing of the Sino/British agreement on Hong Kong, the Treasury seems ready to turn a blind eye to it all.”

There is also continued frustration about Johnson’s stonewalling over the appointment of Tim Loughton, one of the MPs banned from China, to the chair of the Conservative Human Rights commission.

The body had been a leading internal Tory pressure group, particularly on Hong Kong which led to its blacklisting by Beijing, but Johnson has declined to approve Loughton as chair for more than a year. Its previous chair, Fiona Bruce, resigned after being appointed a special envoy on religious freedom by Johnson.

Loughton has been a strong critic of the prime minister’s conduct over “partygate” as well as the cut to international aid. The rights activist Benedict Rogers, the commission’s deputy chair, is understood to have privately expressed deep frustration at the impasse. Rogers declined to comment.

Another source from inside the group said they were “deeply troubled about this government’s commitment to freedom and human rights, the rule of law and democracy”.

Other MPs who have been sanctioned include Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Nus Ghani, the former transport minister who has been a leading campaigner on Uyghur genocide, and Neil O’Brien, the Levelling Up minister.

The sanction came after their campaign to insert a clause in the trade bill, which would have permitted the high court to make a preliminary ruling on whether genocide was occurring in a potential trading partner, a clause design to put barriers on a trade deal with China.

Loughton, MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, said the government should be aware of a significant parliamentary backlash to any change of approach towards China.

“Parliament has made it very clear that a government guilty of genocide needs to be treated with extreme caution and cannot be welcomed as an equal partner,” he said. “It would be an insult to parliament if the government were to ignore our concerns not least when seven Parliamentarians remain sanctioned simply for speaking the truth and standing up to China’s bullying and abuse.”

Bob Seeley, who will lead a backbench debate on China next week, said: “We need to engage, but we have to engage as much on our own terms as possible and was understanding the risks of doing so.

“I think we have not yet got our heads around these new authoritarian states and both the obvious threats they pose but also the more subtle threats they pose. We are trying to have business as normal. The world has changed. You’re not a sabre-rattler or a war monger for stating what everyone can see.”",,,,,,,,,tory mp warn backlash easing ukchina trade article year old boris johnson driving change approach despite party voice campaigning uyghur genocide jessica elgot thu feb gmt share conservative mp warned parliamentary backlash following step taken government ease tension china designed pave way better trading relation past week boris johnson quietly signalled thaw frosty relation since decision exclude chinese telecom giant huawei uk g network communication chief guto harri former spinner huawei though previous chief staff dan rosenfield also advocate mending relation prime minister ordered restart ukchina joint economic trade commission jetco year rishi sunak understood verge agreeing return annual trade summit th ukchina economic financial dialogue efd held since treasury cannot shake orthodoxy must better trading term china one senior source said downing street really want boris always uneasy cancel huawei efd previously used announce lucrative commercial contract closer trade cooperation treasury source played significance return efd go ahead said would chance dialogue rather leading major change source said wrong portray sunak driving force chancellor view principle guide relationship china need eye wide open increasing international influence must take principled stand issue conflict value move defrost relation beijing understood source tension johnson foreign secretary liz truss liz proper china hawk another senior government source said truss scheduled meet delegation mp banned china lobbying sanction oppose uyghur genocide coming day uk trade deficit china tripled last year importing bn china exported country significant change approach threatens reopen split backbencher especially blacklisted beijing understood feel received tangible support government including crucial issue like cybersecurity sir iain duncan smith former cabinet minister said beggar belief reinvent failed project kowtow blamed treasury downing street overeagerness normalise relation whether ccps illegal seizure militarisation south china sea trashing sinobritish agreement hong kong treasury seems ready turn blind eye also continued frustration johnson stonewalling appointment tim loughton one mp banned china chair conservative human right commission body leading internal tory pressure group particularly hong kong led blacklisting beijing johnson declined approve loughton chair year previous chair fiona bruce resigned appointed special envoy religious freedom johnson loughton strong critic prime minister conduct partygate well cut international aid right activist benedict rogers commission deputy chair understood privately expressed deep frustration impasse rogers declined comment another source inside group said deeply troubled government commitment freedom human right rule law democracy mp sanctioned include tom tugendhat chair foreign affair select committee nu ghani former transport minister leading campaigner uyghur genocide neil obrien levelling minister sanction came campaign insert clause trade bill would permitted high court make preliminary ruling whether genocide occurring potential trading partner clause design put barrier trade deal china loughton mp east worthing shoreham said government aware significant parliamentary backlash change approach towards china parliament made clear government guilty genocide need treated extreme caution cannot welcomed equal partner said would insult parliament government ignore concern least seven parliamentarian remain sanctioned simply speaking truth standing china bullying abuse bob seeley lead backbench debate china next week said need engage engage much term possible understanding risk think yet got head around new authoritarian state obvious threat pose also subtle threat pose trying business normal world changed youre sabrerattler war monger stating everyone see

Exclusive: vice-president Victor Zhang says north-south divide in England would be exacerbated by missing out on 5G

The UK should revisit its decision to ban the Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei from its 5G network in the post-Trump era and recognise that it will worsen England’s north-south divide, the vice-president of Huawei has told the Guardian.

Victor Zhang’s intervention comes as Boris Johnson prepares on Monday to meet the Northern Research Group, the lobby group of Conservative MPs determined to turn the prime minister’s levelling up agenda into a reality. Zhang urged the UK to stay true to its roots as the birthplace of the first Industrial Revolution, saying the government could not afford to fall behind in the 5G revolution.

In July the UK government, after pressure from the Trump administration, reversed a plan to let Huawei be a controlled 5G supplier, and instead ordered Huawei equipment be stripped out of the country’s 5G networks by 2027.

Ministers at the time said the reversal was not caused by a new security services analysis of the security threat posed by Huawei, but by the Trump administration’s decision to block US conductors being used by Huawei.

Zhang said: “The decision is going to have a huge economic impact on the UK. The UK wants to see a balance of investment between London, the south-east, the Midlands and the north of England. World-class connectivity is crucial to this objective, and without that it is very difficult to close the gap in the economic imbalance in the UK.”

He added: “The government itself has said it will lead to a three-year delay in the rollout of 5G, and this will have a huge economic impact. Many people are surprised by the scale of the impact of this delay. Third-party research by Assembly, an independent research firm, shows this delay will have an £18.2bn impact.

“The research shows it will widen the north-south digital divide. In the north, the broadband carriage and speeds are already far behind London and the south-east. The delay in developing 5G will worsen the situation. The government is committed to superfast broadband by 2025, and with this decision the objective of levelling up becomes unachievable.”

If 5G were delivered nationwide without delay, three-quarters of its expected economic benefit would be likely to come in regions outside London and the south-east.

Urging ministers to revisit the decision, Zhang said: “I hope the government will keep an open mind and, once they review the economic consequences, look to see if there is a better way forward.”

He added: “As a global company we want to work with governments to ensure they have the policies to secure growth. The decision was a political one motivated by US perceptions of Huawei and not those of the UK. This is not really motivated by security, but about a trade war between the US and China.” He said he hoped the new US administration would adopt a different approach to that of Donald Trump.

Zhang also expressed fears that the UK’s traditional role as an open, free trading nation was under challenge, and rejected claims that his company represented the “dragon in the nest”, a phrase used by the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat.

He said: “Something is worrying me about the UK because discussions here are focused on the geopolitical conflict rather than how to improve the UK economy and make sure the country grabs the opportunity again to be a global leader post-Brexit, at the end of this year. All this is vital for the UK’s recovery post-Covid and after Brexit – trade, technology, digitalisation and how to attract foreign investment to the UK.

“The UK was the birthplace of the first Industrial Revolution and it was going to lead the digital revolution. The UK has the DNA to develop the right policies to seize leadership in innovation.”

Critics of Huawei claim that despite the independent shareholder structure, the company can be directed at any minute by the Chinese Communist party to give its regime a backdoor to spy on British communications.

Zhang pointed out: “GCHQ concluded the technical risks were manageable and so did two parliamentary select committees. Personally, I don’t think there is a security reason for the UK to stop using Huawei. America put pressure on the UK through sanctions on Huawei, and the UK – impacted by these new, unjustified sanctions – responded.”

In August Washington announced that companies would have to obtain a licence before selling Huawei any microchip that has been made using US software or equipment.

Zhang argued for the importance of 5G, saying it was a massive step up from 4G in terms of capacity, speed and volume. “This makes it essentially the foundation for next-generation technology – AI/robotics/smart healthcare and education … The fast speed and near-instant latency mean tech can talk in almost real time … Those who come earlier to this will have considerable advantages over those who come later.”",,,,,,,,,uk revisit g ban trump defeated say huawei article year old exclusive vicepresident victor zhang say northsouth divide england would exacerbated missing g patrick wintour diplomatic editor mon nov gmt share uk revisit decision ban chinese telecom equipment maker huawei g network posttrump era recognise worsen england northsouth divide vicepresident huawei told guardian victor zhangs intervention come boris johnson prepares monday meet northern research group lobby group conservative mp determined turn prime minister levelling agenda reality zhang urged uk stay true root birthplace first industrial revolution saying government could afford fall behind g revolution july uk government pressure trump administration reversed plan let huawei controlled g supplier instead ordered huawei equipment stripped country g network minister time said reversal caused new security service analysis security threat posed huawei trump administration decision block u conductor used huawei zhang said decision going huge economic impact uk uk want see balance investment london southeast midland north england worldclass connectivity crucial objective without difficult close gap economic imbalance uk victor zhang view image fullscreen huaweis vicepresident victor zhang giving evidence science technology select committee july photograph house commonspa added government said lead threeyear delay rollout g huge economic impact many people surprised scale impact delay thirdparty research assembly independent research firm show delay bn impact research show widen northsouth digital divide north broadband carriage speed already far behind london southeast delay developing g worsen situation government committed superfast broadband decision objective levelling becomes unachievable g delivered nationwide without delay threequarters expected economic benefit would likely come region outside london southeast urging minister revisit decision zhang said hope government keep open mind review economic consequence look see better way forward added global company want work government ensure policy secure growth decision political one motivated u perception huawei uk really motivated security trade war u china said hoped new u administration would adopt different approach donald trump zhang also expressed fear uk traditional role open free trading nation challenge rejected claim company represented dragon nest phrase used chair foreign affair select committee tom tugendhat said something worrying uk discussion focused geopolitical conflict rather improve uk economy make sure country grab opportunity global leader postbrexit end year vital uk recovery postcovid brexit trade technology digitalisation attract foreign investment uk uk birthplace first industrial revolution going lead digital revolution uk dna develop right policy seize leadership innovation critic huawei claim despite independent shareholder structure company directed minute chinese communist party give regime backdoor spy british communication zhang pointed gchq concluded technical risk manageable two parliamentary select committee personally dont think security reason uk stop using huawei america put pressure uk sanction huawei uk impacted new unjustified sanction responded august washington announced company would obtain licence selling huawei microchip made using u software equipment zhang argued importance g saying massive step g term capacity speed volume make essentially foundation nextgeneration technology airoboticssmart healthcare education fast speed nearinstant latency mean tech talk almost real time come earlier considerable advantage come later

By Alexander Smith
LONDON — The United Kingdom announced Tuesday that Huawei would be banned from its high-speed 5G telecommunications network, in a decision that will anger China but please the United States.

The role of the Chinese tech giant has become a central theme in London's increasingly uneasy relationship with Beijing.

The U.K. has faced months of pressure from Washington, which says Huawei is a security risk because the company could be used by the Chinese government to spy on the West. Both China and Huawei have repeatedly denied this.

""There's no such thing as a perfectly secure network,"" Media Secretary Oliver Dowden told the House of Commons, but he said that the U.K. had to make sure its system was ""as secure as it possibly can be.""

He announced that all new Huawei 5G equipment would be banned in the U.K. starting next year, and that the government would remove all of the company's existing infrastructure by 2027.

The decision attempts to balance technology, geopolitics and the practical impact on consumers. Dowden conceded that banning Huawei would delay the U.K.'s 5G rollout by two years and cost up to 2 billion pounds, around $2.5 billion.

""This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide,"" Huawei's U.K. spokesman Ed Brewster said in a statement.

The decision had become ""politicized,"" he added, and was more about U.S. trade friction with China than real security concerns. The company will now conduct a detailed review of the decision and continue to work with the U.K. government to ""explain how we can continue to contribute to a better connected Britain,"" he said.

The U.K.'s widely anticipated decision came after a meeting earlier Tuesday of Britain's National Security Council, which was chaired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Back in January, Johnson attempted a compromise that he hoped would placate both Beijing and Washington. Huawei was to be allowed a limited role in building the country's 5G network, but prevented from accessing ""sensitive"" core areas and those near military or nuclear sites.

Tuesday's announcement was a reversal of that move. The official reason was that U.S. sanctions on Huawei, banning it from using American microchips, would make the Chinese company's technology unreliable in the future.

But the backdrop is one of a mighty struggle between the U.S. and China spanning technology and trade. A central strand of that is 5G, which offers speeds 10 times faster than 4G and promises to reshape many aspects of daily life. Its providers will be powerful players in the coming years.

""Today’s decision by the UK to ban Huawei from its 5G networks advances Transatlantic security in the #5G era while protecting citizens’ privacy, national security, and free-world values,"" tweeted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo following the announcement on Tuesday.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.K., Woody Johnson, also tweeted saying Britain's ""decision to protect its national security"" was also a ""win for fair trade and human rights.""

While London has been a key U.S. ally for decades, just five years ago its government embarked on what it said would be a ""golden era"" of engagement with China. It now finds itself caught in the middle of this standoff just as it is attempting to strike out on its own by leaving the European Union, the world's biggest political and economic bloc.

The U.S. points to China's National Intelligence Law of 2017, which says companies must ""support, cooperate with and collaborate in national intelligence work."" Many of Johnson's own Conservative lawmakers are similarly uneasy about the firm's presence in Britain.

Added to that, there has been a feeling of dismay in the U.K. and the U.S. at what they see as China's crackdown on liberties in Hong Kong and alleged attempts to cover up aspects of the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, both of which China rejects.

Huawei denies it has been asked to give up its data or that it would ever do so. It insists that for the next five years at least, it can supply U.K. hardware unaffected by U.S. sanctions.

　　Original title: Britain’s ban on Huawei 5G gave two time points, experts analyze the mystery behind it

Source: GettySource: Getty
　　Overseas Network, July 16th. On the 14th, the UK made a self-proclaimed “not an easy decision”: banning Huawei 5G. Six months ago, the UK endorsed Huawei as having ""no security risks"" and hinted that it would give Huawei a ""green light"" for 5G. However, in July, it quickly ""turned its back"" and its back-and-forth attitude caused an uproar in public opinion. Some analysts say that behind this 180-degree change, there are more political considerations than commercial factors. However, judging from the two time points given, it is ""very mysterious"" and seems to leave room for maneuver.

　　　　The ban was criticized

　　On the 14th local time, the British government decided to ban the country's mobile operators from purchasing Huawei 5G equipment starting in 2021, and to exclude Huawei from the UK's 5G equipment supply by 2027. British Culture Secretary Dowden admitted that this move would delay the construction of 5G in the UK by one year, but insisted that it is ""about maintaining the long-term security of the British telecommunications network.""

　　""Disappointing"", ""car accident scene"", ""self-harm""... British media and politicians used these words to describe the decision to ban Huawei. The UK's two largest telecoms operators, Vodafone and BT, have warned that removing installed Huawei equipment is expected to cost ""billions of pounds"" and delay the rollout of 5G in the UK. The Financial Times stated that even if the British government does not allow Huawei to retain a ""long-term role"" in 5G construction, it should not be ""quickly deleted."" The cost of banning Huawei is that the UK loses its global leadership in 5G development.

　　The Times of the United Kingdom believes that it is ""impossible"" to remove all Huawei technology from the British mobile network because of the huge cost and the fact that it is currently unrealistic to replace Huawei with network equipment from Nokia and Ericsson. CNN stated that banning Huawei’s new equipment and replacing its existing technology will delay the construction of the British 5G network by two to three years, which also means that British consumers and businesses will have to wait longer. Pay more to get 5G service.

　　British Labor MP and Shadow Cabinet Industrial Policy Spokesperson Onwula bluntly said that Huawei's decision was ""incredibly negligent"" and described its impact on the development of the British digital economy as ""like a car accident."" During a discussion in the House of Commons, she asked the government to guarantee that the cost of removing Huawei's 5G equipment will not be borne by consumers.

　　British media also quoted experts as saying that after the epidemic crisis, too radical policy changes may hinder the UK's economic recovery. The British government is anxious to abandon telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei, which may hinder the resumption of work and production in the UK. The British National Institute of Economic and Social Research analyzed that if banning Huawei leads to trade conflicts, the British gross domestic product (GDP) will drop by 0.75%.

　　Difficult to get rid of

　　How important is Huawei to the British market? A set of British official data can illustrate the problem: 44% of the UK's high-speed optical fiber access, 35% of 4G share, and 17% of the communication core are provided by Huawei. The cooperation between the British government and Huawei can be traced back to 20 years ago. In 2001, Huawei opened its first office in the UK. It first upgraded the copper cable broadband network for British Telecom, and then entered most of the British Telecom industry chain. Participate in the construction of communication infrastructure. In recent years, Huawei has become the UK's most important telecommunications partner.

　　Some analysts believe that to get rid of Huawei equipment, it is necessary to turn to other suppliers, purchase new equipment as soon as possible, and successfully assemble it. However, this is a lengthy procurement negotiation that may take one to two years to complete. Replacing existing equipment and wiring also takes time to plan.

　　The Wall Street Journal of the United States observed that the seven-year time limit provided by the United Kingdom also shows that ""it is difficult to completely get rid of Huawei."" The British government listened to the advice of telecom executives: it will take at least five years, or even seven years, to recover. Abandoning Huawei will cause major disruption to the UK's emerging network construction.

　　""Issuing a ban on Huawei is an act of national self-inflicted harm."" Former British MP George Galloway published a commentary in ""Russia Today"", saying that the British economy shrank severely in the last quarter, and today's decision is tantamount to destroying the world's second largest economy. Large economies launch economic confrontation. Martin Jacques, a senior fellow at the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Cambridge, also criticized the decision on social media, believing that the United Kingdom should not regard China as an enemy. This period will be recorded in British history as an act of ""national suicide.""

　　who is causing trouble

　　""There is a heavy shadow behind the British decision - the United States,"" Russia Today TV said. CNBC pointed out that the U.S. government has been pressuring the ""Five Eyes Alliance"" countries to phase out Huawei, and has even threatened to stop the exchange of sensitive intelligence with allies that violate U.S. requirements. The United States did not ""avoid suspicion."" Just after the United Kingdom announced its decision on the 14th, the ""greetings"" from the U.S. Secretary of State came and welcomed the decision. U.S. President Trump also admitted in his speech that day that he had ""personally persuaded"" many countries, including the United Kingdom, to ban Huawei under the pretext of business dealings.

　　In fact, as early as January this year, the British government stated that it would allow Huawei to participate in 5G construction on a ""limited basis"", becoming the only country in the ""Five Eyes Alliance"" that allows Huawei to participate in 5G network construction. However, after the outbreak of the new coronavirus, anti-China sentiment in British politics rebounded, and more Conservative MPs began to put pressure on Johnson on the Huawei issue. The Financial Times analyzed that the UK's attitude towards Huawei has changed 180 degrees in half a year, mainly due to the ""double pressure"" from domestic conservative politicians and the US government.

　　Regarding the sudden ""change of face"" of the UK, Zhang Monan, chief researcher of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, told Overseas Network that the UK's political considerations in banning Huawei outweigh security considerations: First, the Johnson government took action against Huawei under pressure from the domestic conservative party; second, like the EU, The UK is also increasingly emphasizing information technology security, hoping to highlight its technological independence and strengthen economic and technological sovereignty by excluding Huawei.


　　In addition, it is worth mentioning that the two deadlines set by the British government are ""very mysterious."" Zhang Monan said that the UK's choice of timing is more like leaving a time window, a process in which you can negotiate back and forth, especially as it spans the US election. In fact, no matter what the outcome of the U.S. election is, it will become a new stage for Washington’s China policy. The UK has half a year to wait and see. After the US election, its China policy will be clearer and clearer, and it will be cheaper for the UK to take action then. In fact, no matter whether the United States or the United Kingdom, banning Huawei is not a so-called threat to national security, but they are worried that once the core technology is mastered by China, they will lose their leading advantage in controlling the world, so they will attack, block, contain, and even Destroy China's 5G technology.

　　Bai Ming, a researcher at the Institute of International Trade and Economic Cooperation of the Ministry of Commerce, also told Overseas Network that 2027 is a long time period, and any infrastructure has a normal wear and tear period. The UK does not rule out the use time difference, waiting for the equipment to reach its useful life. Then completely replaced. In addition, in the past seven years, with the iteration of technology, 6G or more advanced solutions may be launched. We do not rule out the wishful thinking of some British people that they hope to be able to smoothly transition to the latest technology by then. It will be natural to ban Huawei 5G equipment. realized.

2022-07-05,禁用中国5G设备后，英国被曝在华为内部安插情报人员，赵立坚“求解惑”,Sohu,,2022-01-18,"After banning Chinese 5G equipment, the UK was exposed to have placed intelligence personnel within Huawei, Zhao Lijian ""asked for answers"" 
2022-01-18 15:21
   
The United Kingdom has followed the United States in banning China's Huawei 5G equipment and related businesses, claiming it is a ""national security issue.""

It was recently exposed that the British side deployed intelligence personnel within Huawei to conduct a comprehensive inspection and confirmed that Huawei did not pose any threat. The person who broke the news was former Singaporean diplomat Mahbubani Mahbubani. He learned of the news through a British business executive. The British business executive affirmed Huawei's capabilities, but he also said helplessly, ""This is war"" and Britain "" Surrender.



Britain ""surrendered""
There is a popular joke on the Internet: In the UK, people like to read books and newspapers when taking the subway, and almost no one is playing with their mobile phones. In sharp contrast, in our domestic subways and buses, we can see people playing with their phones with their heads down everywhere.

This comparison has been widely praised by the public for the high quality of British people's love of reading. In fact, because of the network signal problem, they couldn't play with their mobile phones at all, and they couldn't do anything else except read books.

Good news comes from the British media. By the end of 2024 at the latest, the subway tunnels and stations in London, the British capital, will achieve full 4G signal coverage.



Yes, you read that right, the end of 2024, London, 4G.

Under such circumstances, the UK actually rejected Huawei.

Therefore, the British business executive who complained to Mahbubani was disappointed: Britain initially chose Huawei, but failed to stick with it after a few months.

Former British Business Secretary Cable also broke the news that banning Huawei's 5G has nothing to do with ""national security."" It was the British government under pressure from the United States and ""the United States told the United Kingdom that it should do this."" Cable said that during his tenure as Business Secretary, the British security and intelligence agencies had repeatedly assured that the use of Huawei services was safe.

But ""coercive diplomacy"" turned Britain into a puppet of the United States. Britain ""surrendered"" when the United States demanded it.



Zhao Lijian ""seeking answers to questions""
As the news spread, reporters asked questions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' regular press conference. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of my country, Zhao Lijian, was still very to the point: Like everyone else, I also want to hear the British side's explanation for this.

In the UK, both Oliver Dowden, the Minister of State in charge of digitalization and culture, and the British media have also stated that the British government’s move to ban Huawei will greatly delay the UK’s 5G construction goals, causing at least 2-3 years of delays. lag.

The Oxford Research Institute in the UK concluded based on a survey that this will lead to a 9%-29% increase in related network deployment costs in the UK in the next 10 years.



While the UK is trying to develop related networks, Huawei is also resisting the pressure and continuing to move forward. Maybe by the end of 2024, when the UK celebrates 4G coverage in London and other parts of the UK are still looking forward to upgrades, Huawei and China will have a further development.

The United States' unscrupulous suppression of Huawei is a stifling plan chosen by the United States for its hegemonic status. It is due to its own lack of confidence. Huawei is a representative of Chinese companies, so it suppresses Samsung and TSMC and seizes resources. In order to ensure the hegemony of the United States, it will not hesitate. However, the UK is hurting others without benefiting itself. It is really puzzling to cut off its flesh and feed it to the United States.

Therefore, Zhao Lijian, who also wants to know what the UK is up to, said that some people and forces in the UK have surrendered to a certain country out of political self-interest, generalized the concept of ""national security"", suppressed specific Chinese companies, and made their own people bear the bitter consequences of not having access to 5G high technology. This is completely It is harmful to others and not beneficial to oneself.

Exchanging national development for political self-interest is the real gain outweighing the losses.Return to Sohu to see more",,,,,,,,,banning chinese g equipment uk exposed placed intelligence personnel within huawei zhao lijian asked answer united kingdom followed united state banning china huawei g equipment related business claiming national security issue recently exposed british side deployed intelligence personnel within huawei conduct comprehensive inspection confirmed huawei pose threat person broke news former singaporean diplomat mahbubani mahbubani learned news british business executive british business executive affirmed huaweis capability also said helplessly war britain surrender britain surrendered popular joke internet uk people like read book newspaper taking subway almost one playing mobile phone sharp contrast domestic subway bus see people playing phone head everywhere comparison widely praised public high quality british people love reading fact network signal problem couldnt play mobile phone couldnt anything else except read book good news come british medium end latest subway tunnel station london british capital achieve full g signal coverage yes read right end london g circumstance uk actually rejected huawei therefore british business executive complained mahbubani disappointed britain initially chose huawei failed stick month former british business secretary cable also broke news banning huaweis g nothing national security british government pressure united state united state told united kingdom cable said tenure business secretary british security intelligence agency repeatedly assured use huawei service safe coercive diplomacy turned britain puppet united state britain surrendered united state demanded zhao lijian seeking answer question news spread reporter asked question ministry foreign affair regular press conference spokesperson ministry foreign affair country zhao lijian still point like everyone else also want hear british side explanation uk oliver dowden minister state charge digitalization culture british medium also stated british government move ban huawei greatly delay uk g construction goal causing least year delay lag oxford research institute uk concluded based survey lead increase related network deployment cost uk next year uk trying develop related network huawei also resisting pressure continuing move forward maybe end uk celebrates g coverage london part uk still looking forward upgrade huawei china development united state unscrupulous suppression huawei stifling plan chosen united state hegemonic status due lack confidence huawei representative chinese company suppresses samsung tsmc seizes resource order ensure hegemony united state hesitate however uk hurting others without benefiting really puzzling cut flesh feed united state therefore zhao lijian also want know uk said people force uk surrendered certain country political selfinterest generalized concept national security suppressed specific chinese company made people bear bitter consequence access g high technology completely harmful others beneficial oneself exchanging national development political selfinterest real gain outweighing lossesreturn sohu see

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 14 (Reporter Zhang Dailei and Zhang Jiawei) A spokesman for Huawei UK said on the 14th that the British government announced the same day that local operators must completely remove Huawei equipment from 5G networks by 2027. This decision The ""disappointing"" decision will damage the UK's digital development.

Huawei UK said in a statement provided to Xinhua News Agency that the British government's decision is ""bad news"" for all mobile phone users in the UK. It may put the UK into the ""slow lane"" of digital development and increase consumption. expenditures and deepen the digital divide.

Oliver Dowden, the British Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, announced the government decision in the House of Commons of the British Parliament that day. He said that in view of the impact of US sanctions against Huawei, the UK will require local operators to completely remove Huawei equipment from 5G networks by 2027. In addition, after December 31 this year, the government will prohibit operators from purchasing any new 5G equipment from Huawei. Dowden said that 5G will bring changes to the UK, but only if the resilience and security of the relevant infrastructure are ensured.

Huawei UK spokesman Ed Brewster said in a statement: ""We are confident that the new US restrictions on Huawei will not affect the resilience and security of the products we supply to the UK.""

""Sadly, our future in the UK has been politicized and has more to do with US trade policy than security issues."" The statement said, ""Huawei has been committed to building better network connections in the UK for the past 20 years. As As a responsible business, we will continue to support our customers.”

　　Suppressing Huawei is dishonorable, disrespectful, and ineffective! | People’s Insights

　　Recently, the British government decided to ban the country's mobile operators from purchasing Huawei 5G equipment starting from 2021, and to exclude Huawei from the UK's 5G equipment supply by 2027. This means that the UK has succumbed to internal and external political pressure and decided to ban Huawei. As soon as the news came out, it triggered widespread criticism in the UK and the international community.

　　As expected, British Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden used rhetoric such as ""national security"" and ""this is a technical decision"" to defend the announcement, but this still cannot conceal the political overtones of this act. Economically speaking, banning Huawei will be very costly for the UK. Dowden himself admitted that banning Huawei means that the rollout of 5G will be delayed by 2 to 3 years cumulatively, and the cost will increase by 2 billion pounds. The spokesman for the industrial policy of the British shadow cabinet bluntly stated that the impact on the development of the British digital economy is ""like a car accident scene"" and ""can be clearly seen even from outer space."" Since the economic costs are high, why does the British government still insist on going its own way? There is political logic behind this, and the United States is the initiator.

　　The coincidence of time is quite meaningful. Just after the UK announced its ban on Huawei, some US politicians claimed that they had persuaded allies to ban Huawei. “If they want to have business contact with us, then they cannot use Huawei.” They even admitted in person that “we have convinced many countries...not to Use Huawei"". Before the UK officially announced its decision, US National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien flew to France to meet with British security officials. The main topic was to demand that Huawei be kicked out of the UK 5G system. This also confirms the judgment that the UK's ban on Huawei "" stems from US trade policy, not security issues."" The British government has acted as a ""political tool"" for the United States to suppress (4.970, -0.01, -0.20%)high - tech companies . This not only damages the open, business-friendly, free and transparent image of the UK, but also damages the UK's independent country. image.


　　In fact, the United States has been increasing its crackdown on Huawei and Chinese high-tech companies. Just in mid-May, the United States revised its export rules for Huawei, restricting the supply of all semiconductor factories around the world that use American software and equipment to Huawei; in June, the United States added 33 Chinese-related institutions and individuals to the export control ""entity list."" . Bannon, the former senior adviser to the US president, made it clear that killing Huawei is ten times more important than reaching a trade agreement with China. The United States' suppression of Huawei is to prevent China from leading the next generation of communications technology, thereby suppressing China's high-tech development. The purpose of this kind of technological bullying is to block China's technological progress and economic upgrading and maintain the United States' technological and economic hegemony.

　　Using state power to suppress an enterprise is neither honorable nor wise, nor effective. The United States and Britain have been selling the market economic principles of free competition to the world, but using political power to suppress China's high-tech companies not only runs counter to the values ​​they profess, but also makes people see that the United States has gone to any lengths to maintain its hegemony. . The progress of science and technology is the common cause of mankind, and the spread of knowledge is not dependent on human will. No country in history has been able to use political power to curb scientific and technological progress. Political suppression cannot stop Huawei's development or China's rise. America's arrogant practices serve no purpose other than proving its own decline.

　　A British scholar commented: China is and will be a key player in the global economy. ""Without China, the UK will have no future."" The British government should listen to such rational voices and stop following other countries to ""dance with the wind"" and rely on others. It should realize that being an enemy of China is not in Britain's own interests. As Huawei said in a subsequent statement, ""We are confident that the new U.S. control measures will not affect the resilience and safety of the products we provide to the UK."" ""We will communicate with the British government to clarify how we will continue to help the UK build a better future."" network connection"". We hope that the British government will stay awake, treat Huawei fairly in accordance with market principles, and work with China halfway to grow together.

　　There is a saying on Huawei's official Weibo: ""If you don't have scars, you won't have rough skin and thick flesh. Heroes have suffered many hardships since ancient times."" ""Look forward and never give up."" For Huawei and China's high-tech companies, the suppression is just a temporary external pressure. This is a threshold that must be overcome. Their fate depends on their own pace of innovation and determination, not external variables. For China, this incident once again shows that no one has given us a bright future, and the road to national rejuvenation is destined to be full of thorns. But we cannot close ourselves off due to external pressure. By persisting in reform and opening up and cooperating with the world, we can overcome temporary difficulties and embrace the prospects of national rejuvenation.",,,,,,,,,people daily commentary suppressing huawei disgraceful unwise ineffective people daily commentary suppressing huawei disgraceful unwise ineffective install sina finance client receive comprehensive market information soon possible download address suppressing huawei dishonorable disrespectful ineffective people insight recently british government decided ban country mobile operator purchasing huawei g equipment starting exclude huawei uk g equipment supply mean uk succumbed internal external political pressure decided ban huawei soon news came triggered widespread criticism uk international community expected british culture secretary oliver dowden used rhetoric national security technical decision defend announcement still cannot conceal political overtone act economically speaking banning huawei costly uk dowden admitted banning huawei mean rollout g delayed year cumulatively cost increase billion pound spokesman industrial policy british shadow cabinet bluntly stated impact development british digital economy like car accident scene clearly seen even outer space since economic cost high british government still insist going way political logic behind united state initiator coincidence time quite meaningful uk announced ban huawei u politician claimed persuaded ally ban huawei want business contact u cannot use huawei even admitted person convinced many countriesnot use huawei uk officially announced decision u national security advisor robert obrien flew france meet british security official main topic demand huawei kicked uk g system also confirms judgment uk ban huawei stem u trade policy security issue british government acted political tool united state suppress high tech company damage open businessfriendly free transparent image uk also damage uk independent country image fact united state increasing crackdown huawei chinese hightech company midmay united state revised export rule huawei restricting supply semiconductor factory around world use american software equipment huawei june united state added chineserelated institution individual export control entity list bannon former senior adviser u president made clear killing huawei ten time important reaching trade agreement china united state suppression huawei prevent china leading next generation communication technology thereby suppressing china hightech development purpose kind technological bullying block china technological progress economic upgrading maintain united state technological economic hegemony using state power suppress enterprise neither honorable wise effective united state britain selling market economic principle free competition world using political power suppress china hightech company run counter value profess also make people see united state gone length maintain hegemony progress science technology common cause mankind spread knowledge dependent human country history able use political power curb scientific technological progress political suppression cannot stop huaweis development china rise america arrogant practice serve purpose proving decline british scholar commented china key player global economy without china uk future british government listen rational voice stop following country dance wind rely others realize enemy china britain interest huawei said subsequent statement confident new u control measure affect resilience safety product provide uk communicate british government clarify continue help uk build better future network connection hope british government stay awake treat huawei fairly accordance market principle work china halfway grow together saying huaweis official weibo dont scar wont rough skin thick flesh hero suffered many hardship since ancient time look forward never give huawei china hightech company suppression temporary external pressure threshold must overcome fate depends pace innovation determination external variable china incident show one given u bright future road national rejuvenation destined full thorn cannot close due external pressure persisting reform opening cooperating world overcome temporary difficulty embrace prospect national rejuvenation

Original title: The UK bans the use of Huawei 5G equipment
　　On July 14, the United Kingdom ordered the country's telecommunications suppliers to stop purchasing 5G equipment from China's Huawei next year and to dismantle all Huawei equipment by 2027. A spokesman for Huawei in the UK said it regretted the incident and would carefully review the impact on future UK business.

　　According to foreign media reports, British Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden announced that the UK has decided to stop using Huawei equipment in 5G construction. Dowden said that the British government will stop purchasing new Huawei equipment from December 31, 2020, and Huawei equipment currently used in the British 5G network must be dismantled by 2027.

　　Huawei UK spokesman Edward Brewster said: This decision is disappointing and is bad news for all mobile phone users in the UK. This could put the UK in the slow lane of digital development, increase consumer spending on communications and deepen the digital divide. Far from ""improving"", this move will actually reduce the UK's level of development. We urge the British government to reconsider this decision. We are confident that the new US controls will not affect the resilience and safety of the products we supply to the UK.

　　The spokesperson also said that it is regrettable that Huawei's future development in the UK has been politicized. The move stems from U.S. trade policy, not security concerns. Over the past 20 years, Huawei has focused on building better network connections in the UK. As a responsible business, we will continue to support our customers as always. “We will carefully review the impact of today’s announcement on our future UK operations and engage with the UK government to set out how we can continue to help build better connectivity across the UK.”

　　The latest information shows that Huawei currently has 1,600 employees in the UK and provides network equipment to all large mobile network and broadband network service providers in the UK.

Beijing warns that removal of telecoms firm from UK network by 2027 will undermine trust

The British government’s decision to ban the use of Huawei in its 5G network is groundless and indicative of the UK’s junior status in its alliance with the US, Beijing has said as it vowed to take measures to protect the interests of Chinese companies.

“Listening to all the rhetoric it was clear the UK had succumbed to pressure from China hawks and bashers,” said Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to the UK. “We are not asking you to take sides between China and the US. We are just asking you to take the right side of the argument. Britain can only be Great Britain when it has an independent foreign policy.”

Huawei had been dumped and purged, he added.

On Tuesday the British government pledged to remove the Chinese telecoms firm from its 5G network by 2027, despite warnings of retaliation from Beijing.

“Any decisions and actions [by Britain] must come at a cost,” Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “China will fully and solemnly assess this matter, and will take a series of necessary measures to safeguard Chinese companies’ legitimate rights and interests.”

Hua claimed London “[acted] in coordination with the US to discriminate against, suppress and eliminate” Huawei, and accused Britain of becoming “America’s dupe”.

Huawei has become a pivotal issue in the geopolitical war between China and the US, which claims the firm poses a significant cybersecurity threat.

Donald Trump claimed credit for the UK move, boasting in a press conference on Tuesday that no White House “has been tougher on China” than his administration.

He said he had worked to pressure countries not to use Huawei. “If they want to do business with us, they can’t use it. We convinced many countries – many countries – and I did this myself, for the most part, not to use Huawei because we think it’s an unsafe security risk. It’s a big security risk.”

Liu referenced Trump’s comments, saying: “President Trump is taking credit for the decision, saying it was his personal success … Everyone understands what is the reason behind the UK decision.”

Ties between the UK and China have deteriorated over the past month after the UK criticised Beijing’s imposition of a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong, a former British colony, and pledged to support fleeing pro-democracy activists and protesters.


Liu said the Huawei decision symbolised a new UK attitude to China, and would do “deep damage to trust between China and the UK at both business and government level”.

He added: “The Chinese government did not need to tell Chinese business how to respond to the UK decision since they would draw their own conclusions. It will undermine trust. Mutual trust and mutual respect is the basis for a relationship not just between countries but between individuals. I would say it is not just disappointing but disheartening.”

Over the past decade, successive UK governments have encouraged the growth of economic ties between Britain and China, which have become more crucial as London finalises its departure from the European Union.

Liu refused to say if the so-called golden era between Britain and the UK had come to an end, pointing out that it had been a phrase proposed by the British, and endorsed willingly by China. He said he hoped Chinese students would still be welcomed in the UK, and said China was not seeking an economic decoupling.

The bulk of his comments formed an appeal to the EU to remain China’s partners, saying there was a huge mutual economic interest, but stressed this had to be based on a mutual acceptance that neither side would interfere in the other’s internal affairs.

“Those who see China as a systematic rival or potentially hostile have got it all wrong, chosen the wrong target and are heading in the wrong direction,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration said on Wednesday it would impose travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies the US determines are assisting authoritarian governments in cracking down on human rights, including in China’s western Xinjiang province.

US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said: “Certain Huawei employees provide material support to the CCP regime that commits human rights abuses. Telecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice: if they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers.”

Seemingly contradicting Trump’s claims, Pompeo denied that the UK U-turn was due to US pressure.

Boris Johnson’s new spin chief asked if the PM’s chief of staff could “nudge” ministers on behalf of controversial Chinese tech giant Huawei, it has emerged.

Long-time ally Guto Harri resigned from Hawthorn Advisors this week to become Downing Street’s Director of Communications, after previous holder Jack Doyle quit over Partygate.

But the lobbying firm had Huawei as a client when he worked there, with reports claiming he was closely involved.

On Monday the PM’s spokesman said he was “not aware of any” meetings between Mr Harri and Boris Johnson personally in the lobbyist’s previous job.

But asked if the PM’s “team” had had any meetings with Mr Harri, the spokesman dodged the question, saying: “Any such meetings that would require to be reported, we would do so in the normal way, but I don’t have a list for individual members.”

Now leaked minutes reveal Mr Harri met with No10’s then-Chief of Staff Sir Eddie Lister on 2 June 2020 in a 25-minute video call.

According to minutes of the meeting seen by The Sun, he asked: “Any ministers we should talk to? Perhaps give a nudge in DCMS or Treasury?”


Downing Street confirmed the meeting today, with Boris Johnson's spokesman saying: ""My understand is that there was a meeting that took place with Huawei and No10 officials, that’s within the rules. Obviously we met with a number of interested parties at that time, while that discussion was taking place, and that was in full compliance with the guidance…

“We then took the decision… to effectively end Huawei’s role within the UK in terms of security.”

Huawei technology will be stripped from the UK's 5G network by 2027 after a Government U-turn in 2020.

138467302962
Ministers initially said Huawei could play a limited role in the broadband infrastructure, but abandoned the plan following pressure from Washington.

MPs claimed in October 2020 that there was “clear evidence of collusion” between Huawei and the “Chinese Communist Party apparatus”. Huawei denies the claims.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman defended Mr Harri's appointment on Monday, saying: ""He provided advice to the clients of a private company.

""That's entirely legitimate, it's in the public domain and obviously we would not exclude from Government someone with valuable experience and expertise.""


But No10 dodged questions on whether Mr Harri had fully passed security checks yet.

The PM’s spokesman said: “Any requisite security measures needed to ensure he can start work in No10 have been undertaken.” But asked if they've actually been completed he replied: “I can’t comment on an individual”.


One government source claimed it could take five months to get the highest-level clearance.

And ex-aide Dominic Cummings responded on Twitter : “To access e.g STRAP3 docs on Huawei, you need to go through 'developed vetting' (DV).

A public affairs firm founded by a senior Tory has been lobbying MPs on behalf of controversial Chinese technology giant Huawei.

Hawthorn Advisors, launched by party co-chairman Ben Elliot in 2013, has been trying to win over Tory backbenchers who are unhappy with Huawei technology being used for the UK’s 5G network.


Mr Elliot, the nephew of the Duchess of Cornwall, was appointed joint party chair by Boris Johnson last July.

Mr Elliot, 44, stood down as a director of Hawthorn this year and entered his shares into trust.




The firm denies there is any conflict of interest.

One MP concerned about UK involvement with Chinese state-backed Huawei said: “We’re being lobbied to give Huawei an even more significant role in our communications infrastructure yet there is irrefutable evidence China poses a risk to us and our allies.

“Ben Elliot, who has privileged access to the Prime Minister, has a financial stake in a firm paid to represent Huawei.

“This raises questions about a potential conflict of interest.” Hawthorn said: “Ben was an investor in Hawthorn when we launched in 2013.

“He has never had any involvement with Hawthorn’s clients.”


The Tory Party said: “Ben Elliot has nothing to do with the running of Hawthorn or its clients.”


The PM is thought to be set to end the use of Huawei tech in the 5G network within months amid fears US sanctions will make the firm’s equipment a security risk.

The Westminster Chinese spy outrage may be the “tip of the iceberg” with even more Beijing agents embedded in UK influential society, experts warned last night.

London lawyer Christine Lee targeted and made donations to MPs, rubbing shoulders even with Prime Ministers over years of manipulating her way into Westminster.

Downing Street said it is ""deeply concerning"" mum-of-two Lee, 58, was able to target MPs in an attempt to make British policy more favourable to Beijing.


MI5 took the rare step of circulating a warning to MPs that she had been engaged in ""political interference activities"" on behalf of China's ruling communist regime.

Last night the claims were dismissed by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman who scoffed that the UK is ""too obsessed with James Bond 007 movies"".

But a former British intelligence officer familiar with Chinese and Russian espionage warned there could be as many as a dozen similar cases.

Our source told the Daily Mirror: “It is naive of senior figures not only apparently to fall for this dubious association but to claim she has not had any effect.

“Do we know for example, absolutely for sure, if anybody was influenced into not objecting earlier to the Huawei 5G proposals in Britain?

“Or that someone who may have otherwise been vocal against China’s human rights abuses may have held back? It is hard to prove either way.

“There could be a number of these agents of influence, perhaps a dozen in the UK, and obviously they will be rattled by this exposure of Christine Lee.


“This disruption of her activities must have come after a very long investigation into her and MI5 must have so much evidence that she cannot fight it.”

No 10 said the scandal was being taken seriously and that ministers remained committed to strengthening anti-espionage legislation through a new counter-state threats bill.

""It will be deeply concerning that an individual who is knowingly engaged in the interference activities of the Chinese Communist Party targeted parliamentarians,"" a spokesman said.

""Safeguarding our democracy will always be an absolute priority for this Government.

""We have robust systems in place but we will always ensure security services and law enforcement have the powers they need to tackle future threats.""

Security Minister, Damian Hinds suggested there will be a probe into how Ms Lee was able to get so close to senior politicians.
Asked on LBC if there will be a review, he said: ""Yes. We're learning all the time, all the implications, of course, have to be able to be taken into account.""

Mr Hinds said the security services have been aware of Lee's activities - including channelling funds to British politicians in an attempt to secure influence - for ""some time"".


Senior Labour MP Barry Gardiner received more than £500,000 over six years to cover staffing costs in his office and employed her son as his diary manager. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by him.

Lee received an award from Theresa May when she was prime minister, for her work on a project promoting good relations between the Chinese and British.

Boris Johnson spoke to Donald Trump this afternoon as he tried to heal relations with the US after his decision to allow Huawei to help build the UK's 5G network sparked fury on both sides of the Atlantic.

The Prime Minister had faced intense lobbying from the US President and from Tory MPs to ban the Chinese tech giant from the network amid security concerns.   

But he decided to press ahead and give Huawei a limited role in the construction of the network, prompting both Republican and Democrat politicians in Washington to call for a review of intelligence sharing arrangements with the UK. 

Former presidential challenger Mitt Romney said the decision was 'disconcerting', Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik said it was 'wrong' and 'a shortsighted mistake', while Senator Tom Cotton said it was like asking the KGB to help build a telephone network during the Cold War. 

Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, told the Commons this afternoon the network had 'nothing to do with how we share classified data' as he tried to assuage US concerns.

But he admitted that all the risks 'cannot be eliminated' as he insisted a new regulatory system would be able to mitigate them.

Mr Johnson desperately tried to head off anger from Britain's allies by pledging to work together to create future alternatives to Huawei's 5G technology. 

He tried to placate Mr Trump with an afternoon phone call which he is thought to have used to set out his reasoning for making the decision. 

A Downing Street spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister spoke to President Trump this afternoon and updated him on the outcome of the UK’s telecoms supply chain review. 

'The Prime Minister underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies.' 

The UK's Huawei move sets the stage for a potentially stormy visit by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who is due to meet Mr Raab for talks in London tomorrow. 

Mr Johnson and his most senior minister signed off limited involvement for the controversial firm at a 90-minute meeting of the National Security Council this morning.

Huawei was branded a 'high risk vendor' but will now be able to take a limited share in 'non-core' parts of the scheme. 

The US administration has urged allies to ban Huawei from their infrastructure, claiming it would be a security risk - something the company vehemently denies.",,,,,,,,,u politician demand uk banned sharing intelligence boris johnson hand chinese tech giant huawei limited role new g network despite security fear chinese company huawei allowed build part new network intelligence boss dismiss fear sovereignty would threatened g deal tech giant limited role despite classed high risk vendor move met backlash u pm mp boris johnson spoke donald trump phone afternoon assuage fear james tapsfield political editor mailonline jack maidment deputy political editor mailonline published january updated january email share k view comment email top home k view comment boris johnson spoke donald trump afternoon tried heal relation u decision allow huawei help build uk g network sparked fury side atlantic prime minister faced intense lobbying u president tory mp ban chinese tech giant network amid security concern decided press ahead give huawei limited role construction network prompting republican democrat politician washington call review intelligence sharing arrangement uk former presidential challenger mitt romney said decision disconcerting republican congresswoman elise stefanik said wrong shortsighted mistake senator tom cotton said like asking kgb help build telephone network cold war dominic raab foreign secretary told common afternoon network nothing share classified data tried assuage u concern admitted risk cannot eliminated insisted new regulatory system would able mitigate mr johnson desperately tried head anger britain ally pledging work together create future alternative huaweis g technology tried placate mr trump afternoon phone call thought used set reasoning making decision downing street spokeswoman said prime minister spoke president trump afternoon updated outcome uk telecom supply chain review prime minister underlined importance likeminded country working together diversify market break dominance small number company uk huawei move set stage potentially stormy visit u secretary state mike pompeo due meet mr raab talk london tomorrow mr johnson senior minister signed limited involvement controversial firm minute meeting national security council morning huawei branded high risk vendor able take limited share noncore part scheme u administration urged ally ban huawei infrastructure claiming would security risk something company vehemently denies

Huawei has been having a torrid time, with the most recent turn of events being the British Government’s announcement that Huawei equipment would no longer be permissible in the country’s 5G network infrastructure.

What’s there will be removed in the coming years, by the end of 2027, and no new Huawei equipment can be bought after the end of this year. A previous ban on Huawei from the most sensitive core parts of the 5G network remains in place. But while this news was heard everywhere, other parts of the story were less audible. If you have a smartphone, tablet, laptop, smartwatch or speaker from the brand, should you be worried?

In short, no.

July 24 update: As if to prove that the infrastructure decision does not mean Huawei smartphones or other gadgets are about to vanish or become less cutting-edge, Huawei has just announced a series of partnerships with other brands. Huawei has recently launched a sensational smart speaker developed in conjunction with Devialet.

The just-announced collaborations are not just badging operations: that Huawei smartphone is crucial. So, there’s a partnership with the leading luggage brand, Samsonite.

More twists and turns in Huawei Vs Trump.
SOPA IMAGES/LIGHTROCKET VIA GETTY IMAGES
Remember Huawei’s stunning victory over U.S. President Trump in late January? After months of lobbying, America’s key security ally, the U.K., elected to choose Shenzhen over Washington. Trump was apoplectic with fury, Boris Johnson’s U.K. government was accused of betrayal. Well, it turns out that the happy ending celebrated by Huawei’s management at the time may have been premature.

Late on March 6 came the news that the U.K. Defence Committee is to launch an inquiry into 5G security, for which you can read an inquiry into the decision to allow Huawei into the U.K.’s next-generation network. Tobias Ellwood, the committee’s chairperson said “we will work to understand the legitimate concerns around the decision to allow Huawei to contribute to the 5G network in the U.K.,” adding that “we will not shy away from tackling the public’s concerns head on.”

With smartphone sales in the balance, a setback in 5G sales in the U.K., especially given the potential to impact other markets, is the last thing the company needs. You can tell there is concern that a revisit of the U.K. decision might be on the cards by Huawei’s response to the latest news. “Over the last 18 months,” the company said in a statement, “the [U.K.] government and two parliamentary committees have conducted detailed assessments of the facts and concluded there is no reason to ban Huawei from supplying 5G equipment on cybersecurity grounds.”

PROMOTED


Washington’s immediate public response to the U.K. decision in January appeared muted—but, behind closed doors, it was the very opposite. Advisers reported that one telephone call between the leaders descended into an angry tirade. But, even so, Trump’s decision to keep an itchy Twitter finger under control was seen as a positive sign that damage to the security alliance might not suffer too badly.

But for the more hawkish politicians in Washington, there has been no such pause. And in the latest move, Republican Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) have penned the Protecting America from Foreign Investors Compromised by the CCP Act, which seeks to threaten the U.K.’s “whitelist” insider status as regards investment in the U.S.

Such a move would damage the integrated nature of the U.K. and U.S. industrial defense and security alliance that sees companies work seamlessly cross-border.

As Rubio explained in a statement, “the U.K.’s recent misguided decision to allow Chinese telecommunications equipment into their 5G infrastructure puts the security and economic interests of the U.S. and our allies at risk. The U.S. must now reevaluate how we engage with our important ally.”

Cruz went further, calling Huawei “a global espionage operation masquerading as a telecom company,” and warning that “Britain is putting the national security of the U.S. and our allies in jeopardy by allowing Huawei to build its 5G infrastructure... This legislation will help protect the U.S. against the dangers posed by deals such as the one our British allies are pursuing.”

And that sentiment is now fairly widespread across U.S. lawmakers—enough that there could be some unexpected consequences on the U.K. that have been thought unlikely until now. On March 3, 20 cross-party U.S. senators wrote to the U.K. parliament, expressing “significant concerns” and urging the decision is “revisited.”

This is a campaign to force the U.K. to change its mind. And while the U.S. pressure is heating up, the real pressure on the U.K. government to change course is coming from closer to home. The U.K.’s hawkish politicians had lobbied furiously for a ban on Huawei prior to the government decision, and they have not toned down their lobbying or their rhetoric since it was made in late-January.

“We have been operating in Britain for nearly 20 years,” Huawei said in its statement, “and played a vital role in the development and delivery of 3G and 4G for people across the U.K. Cybersecurity requires high and common standards across the telecoms industry, which Huawei has always supported. Creating a 5G Britain rightly requires scrutiny and we will work with the Select Committee to address their questions in the coming months.”

“This makes no logical sense,” former party leader Sir Iain Duncan-Smith wrote in a column on February 9. “It is inconceivable that such a decision should be made in the face of all the evidence of the threat that China poses to us and our allies.”

This week, a meeting of U.K. parliamentarians debated the issue and their options. With the decision made, the consensus among that growing group of politicians is that the agreed cap on Huawei equipment, now 35%, should be reduced to 0% in the next few years, meaning no Huawei kit in the U.K.’s 5G network.

“We have infuriated the Americans and our other allies in the Five Eyes,” Tory MP Owen Paterson warned the meeting. “Should we not have a concerted programme now with the Five Eyes allies to get to 0% over a short period of time?

This will come to a head next week, on Tuesday (March 10), when those Tory MPs seek to force a law through parliament to amend the U.K. government decision. The cut-off they ask for will be 2022, a move to appease the U.S. but give U.K. networks time to plan, they say, without impacting too heavily on 5G deployment plans.

As reported by the Financial Times, the amendment would bar networks from using “equipment supplied by companies deemed to be ‘high risk vendors’ by the National Cyber Security Centre” after that date, but may well be “onerous for operators—the U.K.’s four mobile networks have all launched 5G services using Huawei kit.”

The hope for Huawei is that the group cannot summon enough votes to force the government’s hand. According to the FT, one of the group claimed “as many as 40 Conservatives could back them—sufficient to inflict a defeat on the government... Another predicted up to 60 Tory MPs could support the amendment... But one prominent rebel said the number was currently nearer 20.”

The stakes are high, and given the angry U.S. response and a groundswell on the Tory back-benches for a revision, a cut-off date might be the most graceful exit for the government. As John Hemmings from the Henry Jackson Society warned in a column on March 4, the U.K. sticking to its decision on Huawei’s 5G inclusion risks grave consequences. “The Five Eyes partners are not about to stop working together—but such a deep and special partnership will not last unless all its members trust that they are working for the same ends.”

If the U.K. is forced to backtrack, that will be a hugely damaging blow to Huawei, which had lauded the example of the U.K. as vindication of its security position. The U.K. is seen as a litmus test for many other nations, given its expertise on cyber and its long-term use of Huawei. The country also has the most extensive setup for evaluating Huawei security risks anywhere in the world.

And to add to this worry, the Information reported on March 6 that the Chinese tech giant is now projecting “a big drop in smartphone sales amid U.S. sanctions—in what would be its first year-on-year decline.” The leaked numbers are material, up to a 20% decline, and that could get worse as the impact of coronavirus takes hold. According to the report, this decline, reversing a decade of uninterrupted growth, “stems from expected weak sales in Europe and other overseas markets—a result of U.S. sanctions that block the company from using Google’s mobile services.”

Despite those sanctions, Huawei still posted smartphone growth in 2019, and maintained its global number two spot behind Samsung and ahead of Apple. The company initially forecast up to 300 million device shipments last year, but ended up shipping 240 million, a smaller than expected 17% uplift on 2018. A 20% decline on this would take them back down below 200 million units, below that 2018 level.

At the start of the year, Huawei chairman Eric Xu said the company was “standing strong in the face of adversity,” but admitted that this year would be harder than last, forecasting this slowing of growth but stopping short of predicting a sharp decline. “Survival will be our first priority,” Xu said, blaming the U.S.

Meanwhile, the challenge Huawei faces in convincing the world of the lack of substance in U.S. charges has taken two other blows recently. First claims that proof of sanctions abuses in Iran has come to light, and then with a subsequent admission from one of the company’s security chiefs that a company of Huawei’s size can’t be certain its equipment is not used for malicious purposes. That point is fair—no tech giant can be, but the timing of such an acknowledgement is unfortunate.

Twists and turns. Again. Huawei had hoped the worst might be behind it with the U.K.’s decision in January, the next few days, though, could be a major setback for the company and throw everything back into the mix.

Behind the news the Boris Johnson’s U.K. government has reversed its decision to allow Huawei into its 5G network is a critical victory for the Trump administration. This has been the achilles heel of its campaign against Huawei, an embarrassment as its closest security ally has ignored its pleas for a ban. Now the embarrassment is over, the U.S. has its victory, and Huawei has been dealt a serious blow.

Even better for the U.S. government is the fact this very public U-turn comes as a direct result of the most recent U.S. sanctions. The U.S. campaign is getting more advanced, more targeted, more effective. The U.K. government described the security implications of those recent U.S. sanctions as “severe,” changing the advice, sending a message to the world that Huawei’s risk has significantly increased.

The U.K. did not want to ban its telcos from buying Huawei equipment—reports suggest this sets back the country’s rollout and comes at a cost. That has been the commercial equation all along—can the U.K. afford to turn its back on cheaper Chinese tech to opt instead for more costly, and they have argued less performant alternatives. To say nothing of the expensive rip and replace of network equipment that has already been installed.

But Washington’s rule change to prohibit Huawei from using silicon that relies on U.S. technology in its design, development or fabrication, made some form of change inevitable. The U.S. knew what it was doing. That explains Huawei using its March presentation of its 2019 results to specifically campaign against such a move and the barrage of threats from China as to consequences for the U.K.

The new Huawei issue is that the specialist evaluation team under the purview of Britain’s GCHQ spy agency says it can no longer guarantee that security risks can be mitigated. Replacing American technology in Huawei kit with Chinese alternatives is a material adverse change. As I’ve said before, if the spooks change their advice then the U.K. government would be forced to move—they have changed and it has moved.

That said, security hawks in the U.K. argue that the change is still a fudge of sorts—essentially standalone 5G equipment purchases are being stopped with a ban on new sales from January. But the current hybrid equipment that uplifts 4G to 5G doesn’t need to be ripped and replaced until 2027. That’s too far away, runs the argument. There is also no action on the widely installed 3G/4G infrastructure.

“I welcome very strongly the Government’s move to block Huawei from UK 5G infrastructure from next year,” Bob Seely MP, coordinator of the Huawei Interest Group, said in a statement. “It is a good, first decision. It is, however, a partial decision—I believe that MPs will have concerns about elements of the statement, including no ban on 3G and 4G and a rip-out date for 5G far into the distance.”

Meanwhile, Huawei is seriously impacted by the news—having celebrated January’s decision as a major victory. “This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the U.K. with a mobile phone,” a company spokesperson said. “It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide—We remain confident that the new U.S. restrictions would not have affected the resilience or security of the products we supply to the U.K. Regrettably, our future in the U.K. has become politicized, this is about U.S. trade policy and not security.”

The U.S. has now hit two devastating strikes on Huawei, targeting the two highest profile parts of its business. Last year, the initial sanctions removed GoogleGOOGL -2.8% software and services from the company’s smartphones. That has heavily impacted sales of phones outside China, where Google is banned in any case. Sales of new flagships launched since U.S. sanctions took effect, the Mate 30 and P40, have disappointed. The company has shored up performance by increasing its domestic revenue base.

Now the hit on Huawei’s silicon supply chain has achieved what more than a year of lobbying failed—it has pulled the flagship U.K. market away from Huawei. America no longer has the embarrassment of its primary defense and intelligence ally allowing Huawei to sell its network equipment in the country. Trump was left furious by the news in January, he will be in fine mood after today’s confirmation of the U-turn that has been widely expected for some weeks now.

The Huawei news was widely expected. For the U.K. hawks it does not go far enough, and it’s likely that Huawei will be celebrating the relatively long timescale before any rip and replace needs to take place. Seven years is a long time in politics—a lot can change, and for a country about to enter the uncertainty of Brexit, China will inevitably wield continual influence over swathes of its economy.",,,,,,,,,trump finally strike huawei uk ban confirmed zak doffman contributor cover security surveillance follow jul edt article year old chinafrancetelecomscompanyhuawei afpgetty image behind news boris johnson uk government reversed decision allow huawei g network critical victory trump administration achilles heel campaign huawei embarrassment closest security ally ignored plea ban embarrassment u victory huawei dealt serious blow even better u government fact public uturn come direct result recent u sanction u campaign getting advanced targeted effective uk government described security implication recent u sanction severe changing advice sending message world huaweis risk significantly increased uk want ban telco buying huawei equipmentreports suggest set back country rollout come cost commercial equation alongcan uk afford turn back cheaper chinese tech opt instead costly argued le performant alternative say nothing expensive rip replace network equipment already installed promoted washington rule change prohibit huawei using silicon relies u technology design development fabrication made form change inevitable u knew explains huawei using march presentation result specifically campaign move barrage threat china consequence uk advertising new huawei issue specialist evaluation team purview britain gchq spy agency say longer guarantee security risk mitigated replacing american technology huawei kit chinese alternative material adverse change ive said spook change advice uk government would forced movethey changed moved there good news body problem season ukraine drainpipe drone open new era long range strike ipad apple accidentally revealed new product seems said security hawk uk argue change still fudge sortsessentially standalone g equipment purchase stopped ban new sale january current hybrid equipment uplift g g doesnt need ripped replaced thats far away run argument also action widely installed gg infrastructure forbes daily join million forbes daily subscriber get best story exclusive reporting essential analysis day news inbox every weekday email address sign signing accept agree term service including class action waiver arbitration provision acknowledge privacy statement forbes protected recaptcha google privacy policy term service apply welcome strongly government move block huawei uk g infrastructure next year bob seely mp coordinator huawei interest group said statement good first decision however partial decisioni believe mp concern element statement including ban g g ripout date g far distance meanwhile huawei seriously impacted newshaving celebrated january decision major victory disappointing decision bad news anyone uk mobile phone company spokesperson said threatens move britain digital slow lane push bill deepen digital dividewe remain confident new u restriction would affected resilience security product supply uk regrettably future uk become politicized u trade policy security u hit two devastating strike huawei targeting two highest profile part business last year initial sanction removed googlegoogl software service company smartphones heavily impacted sale phone outside china google banned case sale new flagship launched since u sanction took effect mate p disappointed company shored performance increasing domestic revenue base hit huaweis silicon supply chain achieved year lobbying failedit pulled flagship uk market away huawei america longer embarrassment primary defense intelligence ally allowing huawei sell network equipment country trump left furious news january fine mood today confirmation uturn widely expected week huawei news widely expected uk hawk go far enough likely huawei celebrating relatively long timescale rip replace need take place seven year long time politicsa lot change country enter uncertainty brexit china inevitably wield continual influence swathe economy

TOPLINE Huawei has failed to adequately resolve security flaws in the equipment used by the U.K. telecom networks, the British government’s cyber-spy agency said in an official report released a few months after the Chinese telecom equipment-maker was barred from the country’s 5G mobile networks over security concerns.

KEY FACTS
The report, prepared by a U.K. government board led by a member of the cyber-intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) found that there had been no evidence that the Chinese firm has made a significant shift on the matter, the BBC reported.

The report added that while some improvements were made by Huawei, the board could only provide ""limited assurance that all risks to UK national security"" could be mitigated in the long-term.

The U.K. government had initiated a review of Huawei’s network equipment after the U.S. government issued sanctions against the company in May restricting it from sourcing key components from American suppliers.

Following the sanctions, Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre had determined that Huawei’s equipment could no longer be considered safe as it had to rely on non-US components.

The Trump administration has cracked down on Chinese tech firms over security concerns within the U.S. while also engaging in diplomatic efforts to pressure European governments to bar Huawei devices from being used in their 5G networks.

BIG NUMBER
£2 billion. That is how much the ban on Huawei would cost the U.K government, as the move would result in a delay of up to three years in the country’s planned 5G rollout, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden had told the British parliament.

TANGENT
Germany is set to impose new restrictions on telecom equipment providers which would effectively prevent Huawei’s devices from being used in the country’s 5G phone networks, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. An IT security bill that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet plans to pass will introduce a two-stage approval process for equipment makers, including a technical check of individual components along with a political assessment of the manufacturer’s “trustworthiness”. While the bill doesn’t explicitly ban Huawei, the report stated that the added bureaucratic approval process would make it nearly impossible for the Chinese firm to participate in building Germany’s 5G network.

PROMOTED


KEY BACKGROUND
In July, the U.K. government announced that it was banning Huawei from its upcoming 5G networks. Under the new law, telecom operators in the country will be forced to stop buying hardware from the Chinese firm by the end of the year and will have until 2027 to strip out existing Huawei devices from their infrastructure. This move was a reversal from a January decision, which allowed limited use of Huawei equipment and angered U.S. President Donald Trump. In June, the Federal Communications Commission had officially designated Huawei as a threat to U.S. communications networks, claiming the company has close ties to the Chinese government and its military services. The agency has barred U.S. telecom companies from using the FCC’s $8.3 billion subsidy fund to purchase any equipment made by the Chinese firm.

New Huawei Global Flagship Store Opens In Shanghai

We now have confirmation, if any was needed, that the U.K.’s decision to ban Huawei from its 5G network came as a direct result of pressure from U.S. President Trump and his security team. There was also the non-trivial issue of an about-turn in the advice from Britain’s spooks to its politicians—the risks with Huawei equipment could no longer be mitigated. This, again, was directly attributable to America’s campaign against the Chinese tech giant. On the surface, this may look like a victory for Washington, but it’s not that simple—Huawei is far from defeated.

The clear implication in the U.K. is that the Huawei decision is all about politics and has little to do with security. The U.K. cyber team charged with defending the realm from the threats associated with Chinese equipment have only changed their view because, at America’s insistence, U.S. components inside Huawei equipment are being replaced by (likely) Chinese equivalents. A change in the political winds—there’s a U.S. election now just a few months away—and both the lobbying and the supply chain restrictions could easily fall away.

This context behind the U.K.’s “materially” changed security report, that the change was fabricated by the U.S., is critical. Absent the latest sanctions, the U.K. advice would not have changed and the reason driving the U.K.’s reversal would not exist. The confirmation from leading chip supplier TSMC, that it will cease supplying Huawei in September per new U.S. rules, was also steeped in the implication that were those rules to soften or change, or were the company to successfully apply for a license to supply, than we’d be quickly back to normal.

PROMOTED


Even the structure of the U.K.’s newly announced reversal is all about the detail. The decision to bar purchases of 5G equipment from next January leaves a sizeable procurement window wide open, and is designed to restrict the acquisition of standalone 5G kit rather than LTE-to-5G upgrades. The long grace period (until 2027) before a rip and replace is mandatory, and the silence on existing 3G and 4G equipment already deployed, have left many options on the table. If a week is a long time in politics, seven years is a lifetime.

Trump was quick to take credit for the U.K. decision, personalizing the victory, and it’s true that the president has campaigned long and hard to persuade his key defense and intelligence ally to toe the U.S. line. But Washington’s relationship with Beijing is starkly different to London’s. The U.S. can brush aside economic threats from China—neither can live without the other. A U.K. facing up to the harsh realities of a post-COVID Brexit is not in such a fortunate position. China issued further threats of “retaliation” in the wake of the Huawei decision. And that carries some weight in a country reliant on Chinese investments in infrastructure and technology, and with a huge install base of Huawei equipment.

Huawei’s U.K. PR chief, Ed Brewster, stressed during a charged BBC Newsnight interview last week, that the company’s mission in the U.K. continues. R&D investments and the decision, announced post the 5G reversal, to open new flagship stores should tell you all you need to know about where Huawei stands on its U.K. future. “We know that millions of people here in the U.K. love our products,” the company said on announcing the £10 million ($12.5 million) investment. Hawkish U.S. politicians come and go, this Chinese giant is playing a much longer game.


The group of U.K. politicians that has lobbied its government hard for tougher sanctions on Huawei knows there is a risk of further changes as this story runs through November’s U.S. election and whatever fallout we see from inquiries into the origins of coronavirus and Beijing’s alleged misinformation. There is also a much wider technology stand-off, one that has now dragged the TikTok into the mix.

The U.S. is fast approaching a decision point as to just how far it wants to take this, before the implications on its own technology sector become much harder to sell back home. The headlines might be filled these days with news of new investments into India, but China is China, and it’s not going to be easily displaced as the world’s centre of tech manufacturing and the world’s hottest consumer market.

Stepping back from this seminal week in the battle between the U.S. and Huawei, it’s hard not to think that the U.K. has left the door ajar for further twists and turns. The decision is solely based on U.S. lobbying and sanctions, and the U.K. does not want to be left holding the check should the U.S. change its tone.",,,,,,,,,yes trump seriously damaged huaweibut isnt yet zak doffman contributor cover security surveillance follow jul pm edt article year old new huawei global flagship store open shanghai vcg via getty image confirmation needed uk decision ban huawei g network came direct result pressure u president trump security team also nontrivial issue aboutturn advice britain spook politiciansthe risk huawei equipment could longer mitigated directly attributable america campaign chinese tech giant surface may look like victory washington simplehuawei far defeated clear implication uk huawei decision politics little security uk cyber team charged defending realm threat associated chinese equipment changed view america insistence u component inside huawei equipment replaced likely chinese equivalent change political windstheres u election month awayand lobbying supply chain restriction could easily fall away context behind uk materially changed security report change fabricated u critical absent latest sanction uk advice would changed reason driving uk reversal would exist confirmation leading chip supplier tsmc cease supplying huawei september per new u rule also steeped implication rule soften change company successfully apply license supply wed quickly back normal promoted even structure uk newly announced reversal detail decision bar purchase g equipment next january leaf sizeable procurement window wide open designed restrict acquisition standalone g kit rather ltetog upgrade long grace period rip replace mandatory silence existing g g equipment already deployed left many option table week long time politics seven year lifetime there good news body problem season ukraine drainpipe drone open new era long range strike ipad apple accidentally revealed new product seems trump quick take credit uk decision personalizing victory true president campaigned long hard persuade key defense intelligence ally toe u line washington relationship beijing starkly different london u brush aside economic threat chinaneither live without uk facing harsh reality postcovid brexit fortunate position china issued threat retaliation wake huawei decision carry weight country reliant chinese investment infrastructure technology huge install base huawei equipment forbes daily join million forbes daily subscriber get best story exclusive reporting essential analysis day news inbox every weekday email address sign signing accept agree term service including class action waiver arbitration provision acknowledge privacy statement forbes protected recaptcha google privacy policy term service apply huaweis uk pr chief ed brewster stressed charged bbc newsnight interview last week company mission uk continues rd investment decision announced post g reversal open new flagship store tell need know huawei stand uk future know million people uk love product company said announcing million million investment hawkish u politician come go chinese giant playing much longer game group uk politician lobbied government hard tougher sanction huawei know risk change story run november u election whatever fallout see inquiry origin coronavirus beijing alleged misinformation also much wider technology standoff one dragged tiktok mix u fast approaching decision point far want take implication technology sector become much harder sell back home headline might filled day news new investment india china china going easily displaced world centre tech manufacturing world hottest consumer market stepping back seminal week battle u huawei hard think uk left door ajar twist turn decision solely based u lobbying sanction uk want left holding check u change tone

CHINA-FRANCE-TELECOMS-COMPANY-HUAWEI
AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES
China’s desperation to defend under-fire Huawei has escalated again this week, with a mix of threats and taunts as the knock-on affects of Washington’s latest sanctions become clearer. “For some people in the U.S.,” a spokesperson for Beijing said on June 10, “there are only two types of people: those who take orders from the U.S. and join it in its attacks against China, and those who don't because they are coerced by China. Such a view is simply narrow-minded and hilarious.”

The issue that’s front and centre here is whether the U.K. will reverse its decision to allow Huawei’s technology into its 5G network. The tug-of-war between Washington and Beijing over Huawei’s U.K. role has been an ever-present in this technology Cold War. When Huawei secured the decision, Washington was furious.

In truth, there was always likely to be a review of the U.K. decision—there are too many security hawks in the governing Conservative Party insisting on some form of time limit. The emerging backlash against China’s alleged disinformation campaign on coronavirus had just added fuel to the fire. And now the latest U.S. sanctions have presented a new security vulnerability that did not exist before. Replacing U.S. tech with Chinese equivalents, runs the theory, is a security game-changer.

PROMOTED


Recognizing this new reality, Beijing threatened the U.K. with ramifications that “ripple far beyond technological concerns,” in the event of a reversal. Taking to state-controlled media, China warned that any “significant escalation of discriminative government interference, [will] almost certainly meet retaliatory responses from Beijing.” This was quickly followed with threats to pull Chinese support for major infrastructure builds in the U.K., including new nuclear plans and the HS2 rail link.

And then Washington stepped into the fray. On June 9, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement to say “the U.S. stands with our allies and partners against the Chinese Communist Party’s coercive bullying tactics.” Pompeo referenced the nuclear power plant threat as well as reported Chinese pressure on Britain’s HSBC to support new Hong Kong security laws. “Shenzhen-based Huawei,” Pompeo said, “is an extension of the Chinese Communist Party’s surveillance state.”

Pompeo and his advisers had repeatedly shuttled between Washington and London in the lead-up to the U.K. Huawei decision in January. That was the time when threats over national security collaboration and intelligence sharing were in the headlines, as the U.S. made clear the repercussions of any Huawei deal. But what are the alternatives, was U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s response at the time.

“Beijing’s aggressive behavior shows why countries should avoid economic over-reliance on China,” Pompeo said, referencing the political threats Beijing reportedly made against Denmark last year, and Australia just this week—which was warned it “will pay an unbearable price” if it sides with America. Pompeo offered to fill any China-shaped gap in the U.K. “The U.S. stands ready to assist our friends in the U.K. with any needs they have, from building secure and reliable nuclear power plants to developing trusted 5G solutions that protect their citizens’ privacy.”

And so the U.K. review of its Huawei decision has become a focal point for the west’s reevaluation of its reliance on Chinese technology and supply chains. The security review was welcomed by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who said countries in the west “cannot ignore the consequences of the rise of China,” adding that “it's even more important that we stand together, North America and Europe together, because we cannot manage this alone.”

“China pursues a defense policy that is defensive in nature,” Beijing’s spokesperson responded to Stoltenberg’s remarks. “We hope NATO can continue viewing China in the correct way, regarding China's development in a rational manner, and contributing to upholding international and regional security and stability. China is ready to enhance dialogue with NATO on the basis of equality and mutual respect.”

Just as in the build-up to the original U.K. decision on Huawei 5G last summer, and the confirmation of that in January, this has become totemic, a hugely symbolic statement over the security of Chinese tech. The U.K. is America’s primary security and intelligence ally, a cornerstone of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing group. Countries around the world will look to its decision. If the U.K., following its security review, with all its experience and expertise says it can no longer mitigate the risks associated with Huawei, other countries will find it more difficult to say they can.

Washington knows this, Beijing knows this, Shenzhen knows this. That’s why there is now an intense Huawei media and PR campaign in the U.K. to again stress its long-term ties to the U.K., its investments and install-base. Huawei is saying that nothing has changed, the basis behind the original decision still stands. The line appears to be that this is all geopolitics and has nothing to do with Huawei or security.

As this intense last week came to an end, U.K. peers in the House of Lords—with the support of hawkish parliamentarians—upped the stakes still further, tabling a proposed amendment to an in-process bill to ban Huawei over the alleged involvement of the company’s Chinese suppliers in Xinjiang. The U.K. government wants this cleared away as it continues its own review—but those hawks say they've learned a lesson from last time, that they will not be held at bay.

The U.K. has a dire recession on its hands and can ill afford the cost of delays or a rip and replace program on its 5G rollout. At the same time, the politics have become treacherous. In reality, it will come down to security advice. If the U.K.’s agencies continue to say that Huawei is a risk that can be managed, despite reports of potential new vulnerabilities, then the government can continue to fudge. But if the security advice changes, the government will have nowhere left to go. Public opinion in the U.K. has now hardened against China, those politics have changed.",,,,,,,,,china crossed another dangerous new line huaweibut already late zak doffman contributor cover security surveillance follow jun edt article year old chinafrancetelecomscompanyhuawei afp via getty image china desperation defend underfire huawei escalated week mix threat taunt knockon affect washington latest sanction become clearer people u spokesperson beijing said june two type people take order u join attack china dont coerced china view simply narrowminded hilarious issue thats front centre whether uk reverse decision allow huaweis technology g network tugofwar washington beijing huaweis uk role everpresent technology cold war huawei secured decision washington furious truth always likely review uk decisionthere many security hawk governing conservative party insisting form time limit emerging backlash china alleged disinformation campaign coronavirus added fuel fire latest u sanction presented new security vulnerability exist replacing u tech chinese equivalent run theory security gamechanger promoted recognizing new reality beijing threatened uk ramification ripple far beyond technological concern event reversal taking statecontrolled medium china warned significant escalation discriminative government interference almost certainly meet retaliatory response beijing quickly followed threat pull chinese support major infrastructure build uk including new nuclear plan h rail link advertising washington stepped fray june secretary state mike pompeo issued statement say u stand ally partner chinese communist party coercive bullying tactic pompeo referenced nuclear power plant threat well reported chinese pressure britain hsbc support new hong kong security law shenzhenbased huawei pompeo said extension chinese communist party surveillance state fromforbes advisor best highyield saving account september bykevin paynecontributor best interest saving account september bycassidy hortoncontributor pompeo adviser repeatedly shuttled washington london leadup uk huawei decision january time threat national security collaboration intelligence sharing headline u made clear repercussion huawei deal alternative uk prime minister boris johnson response time forbes daily join million forbes daily subscriber get best story exclusive reporting essential analysis day news inbox every weekday email address sign signing accept agree term service including class action waiver arbitration provision acknowledge privacy statement forbes protected recaptcha google privacy policy term service apply beijing aggressive behavior show country avoid economic overreliance china pompeo said referencing political threat beijing reportedly made denmark last year australia weekwhich warned pay unbearable price side america pompeo offered fill chinashaped gap uk u stand ready assist friend uk need building secure reliable nuclear power plant developing trusted g solution protect citizen privacy uk review huawei decision become focal point west reevaluation reliance chinese technology supply chain security review welcomed nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg said country west cannot ignore consequence rise china adding even important stand together north america europe together cannot manage alone china pursues defense policy defensive nature beijing spokesperson responded stoltenbergs remark hope nato continue viewing china correct way regarding china development rational manner contributing upholding international regional security stability china ready enhance dialogue nato basis equality mutual respect buildup original uk decision huawei g last summer confirmation january become totemic hugely symbolic statement security chinese tech uk america primary security intelligence ally cornerstone five eye intelligence sharing group country around world look decision uk following security review experience expertise say longer mitigate risk associated huawei country find difficult say washington know beijing know shenzhen know thats intense huawei medium pr campaign uk stress longterm tie uk investment installbase huawei saying nothing changed basis behind original decision still stand line appears geopolitics nothing huawei security intense last week came end uk peer house lordswith support hawkish parliamentariansupped stake still tabling proposed amendment inprocess bill ban huawei alleged involvement company chinese supplier xinjiang uk government want cleared away continues reviewbut hawk say theyve learned lesson last time held bay uk dire recession hand ill afford cost delay rip replace program g rollout time politics become treacherous reality come security advice uk agency continue say huawei risk managed despite report potential new vulnerability government continue fudge security advice change government nowhere left go public opinion uk hardened china politics changed

TOPLINE The U.K. government will ban Huawei from its 5G networks — barring telecom companies from purchasing equipment made by the Chinese firm — in a move that is a sharp u-turn from its previous stance and a major diplomatic win for the Trump administration and the U.S.

KEY FACTS
Network operators in the country will be forced to stop buying hardware from the Chinese telecom equipment maker by the end of the year and will have until 2027 to strip out existing Huawei devices from their infrastructure, U.K. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the parliament.

The move is a reversal from a January decision, which allowed limited use of Huawei equipment in the country’s next-generation 5G mobile networks and angered U.S. President Donald Trump.

The U.K. government had initiated a review of Huawei after sanctions issued on the company by the U.S. in May restricting it from sourcing key components from American suppliers.

Following the sanctions, Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre had determined that Huawei’s equipment could no longer be considered safe as it had to rely on non-US components.

Despite the ban, telecom operators in the country will not be expected to remove older 2G, 3G or 4G equipment made by Huawei.

The U.K government’s decision follows U.S. pressure on European governments to bar Huawei devices from being used in their 5G networks.

CRUCIAL QUOTE
“This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the U.K.’s telecoms networks, for our national security and our economy both now and indeed in the long run,” U.K. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the parliament.

BIG NUMBER
£2 billion. That is how much the ban on Huawei would cost the U.K government according to Dowden as it would result in a delay of up to three years in the country’s planned 5G rollout.

SECTION TITLE
Late last month, the Federal Communications Commission had officially designated Huawei as a threat to U.S. communications networks, claiming the company has close ties to the Chinese government and its military services. As a result of the order, U.S. telecom companies were barred from using the FCC’s $8.3 billion subsidy fund to purchase any equipment made by the Chinese firm. Following the U.K. government’s initial decision in January, U.S. Attorney General William Barr had suggested that the U.S. should consider acquiring a controlling stake in European telecom equipment makers Nokia and Ericsson to “blunt” Huawei’s “drive to domination.” Later in February, the U.S. Senate had voted unanimously to pass a bill that banned the purchase of telecom equipment from Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and included a $1 billion fund to help rural telecom providers “rip and replace” existing Huawei equipment.

Under pressure from a cabal of Conservative MPs, security experts, and President Donald Trump himself, Johnson has pulled plans to involve the Chinese telecoms giant in Britain’s 5G network infrastructure, reports suggest. It was only earlier this year that Huawei had its role in the country’s digital future confirmed. That decision followed parliamentary assent for the firm to help broaden Britain’s next generation network, so long as its involvement was capped at 35%. But now, reports indicate that Johnson has ordered officials to ensure that Huawei is expunged from 5G plans by 2023. Privacy - Terms 4/5/24, 12:38 AM Thursday, April 4.

[+] GETTY IMAGES In many ways, this comes as no surprise. Enlisting the company was his predecessor's idea—a scheme Johnson was never especially keen on, insiders say. His scepticism is no doubt driven by widely-held—though hotly disputed—fears that Huawei’s tech could be infiltrated by Chinese state snoopers. It was on the back of such concerns that Conservative MPs mounted a parliamentary rebellion in March, almost defeating the government in a critical vote on network expansion. These fears are echoed in the highest echelons of Britain’s security community, it seems, with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) confirming in recent days that a new enquiry will examine Huawei’s U.K. operation.

Johnson’s Beijing-boycott might extend beyond telecoms, too— reports indicate that the British government is seeking to end its reliance on Chinese medical supplies and other strategic imports. Greater self-sufficiency is surely to be welcomed, regardless of geo-politics. But by adopting policies that serve the interests of Washington, Britain becomes a player in the nascent SinoAmerican cold war. This carries its own risks. Beijing has been as direct as Washington: if the U.K. locks Chinese firms out, the two nation’s bilateral trade—valued at over $90 billion annually—will suffer. And then there’s the growing threat of China leveraging its economic advantage in Europe, seizing on the continent’s financial frailty amid the COVID-19 crisis to scoop up critical businesses.

[+] VCG VIA GETTY IMAGES The U.K. is preparing to cut Huawei out of the country’s 5G infrastructure by the end of the year, according to a report in The Telegraph. U.K Prime Minister Boris Johnson is gearing up to make the major policy change after GCHQ “revised” its previous belief that the country could manage any security risks from Huawei products.

Officials are said to be crafting proposals to prevent new Huawei equipment being installed in the 5G network in as little as six months, as well as speeding plans to remove Huawei equipment that is already in place. One Whitehall source told The Sunday Times the U.S. sanctions ""fundamentally changes the calculation"" about the firm. “The U.S. sanctions on Huawei are unlike anything we've ever seen before,” the source said. “The company is forbidden from using American intellectual property (IP) in its semi-conductors - they can't even use tools to make new semi-conductors if those tools use American IP.

""The impacts are so severe that, given the need to give clarity to industry, there will be a decision taken and parliament will be notified this month.” In response to The Telegraph’s report, a Huawei spokesman said: ""Huawei is the most scrutinised vendor in the world and we firmly believe our unrivalled transparency in the U.K. means we can continue to be trusted to play a part in Britain's gigabit upgrade. ""It's important to focus on facts and not to speculate at this time."" Back in January, Johnson granted Huawei, along with other “high-risk” Chinese companies, a “limited” role in 5G infrastructure, allowing it to be involved in non-core parts of the network, despite a backlash from senior figures within the Conservative party.

The Economist popped a monocle, and spun up a bright red cover story, subliminally hysterical, entitled “Trade Without Trust”… The Economist goes on to explain, adopting their once-upon-atime style: And after tendering the reader “anarchy” and “collapse,” the editors push on to their conclusion: (This verges on economic nihilism. Unworthy of such a venerable journal, I would say. One wonders how much of “China’s nature” we are obliged to go along with. Does that include hostage-taking as a negotiation technique (viz., the two Canadians being held by the Chinese state in solitary confinement since 2018, to trade for Huawei’s CFO Meng Wanzhou)? Does it waiver the “reeducation” camps in Xinjiang which Huawei may or may not be helping to technologize?) “The West doesn’t trust China anymore. It still has to find a way to do business with Chinese firms.” “Nineteen years ago an unknown Chinese company set up its first European sales offices, in a suburb of Frankfurt and an English commuter town, and started bidding to build telecoms networks. Today Huawei symbolizes the daunting rise of China Inc—and a global trading system in which trust has collapsed.” “If open societies and authoritarian China are to keep their economic links and avoid a descent into anarchy, a new trade architecture is needed.” “A new trade regime is needed that acknowledges China’s nature… The West cannot fundamentally change China or ignore it.” 4/5/24, 12:41 AM Is The UK Ban On Huawei The ‘Endgame’ For Free Trade? https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2020/07/24/is-the-uk-ban-on-huawei-the-endgame-for-free-trade/?sh=472d004546db 3/6 But as to Huawei – first, to recap: They are of course the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world. They are Beijing’s number 1 national “champion.” They are deeply invested in the narrative of China’s Rise. Yes, they have been under siege by various branches of the U.S government – but the American campaign was seen by many as mere sound and fury, to be resolved in the end as part of the Really Big Deal on trade between the economic superpowers. On what was this supposition based? Well, last year President Trump himself allowed that it was “possible that Huawei would be included in a trade deal.” And after all, we’d seen this movie already once. Huawei’s Chinese rival, ZTE, was accused, threatened, roughed up, dangled over the ledge, and then reprieved and restored to a (somewhat diminished) legitimacy. Yes, it is vexing that Huawei – and Beijing – haven’t drawn the obvious lesson. But still, it had seemed inconceivable that the U.S might actually “go nuclear” on Huawei. The company is too big, too important to China, and too well-established in the market to quash completely. The pressures being applied to our allies were interpreted as the usual pro forma American bluster. As recently as January, it seemed as though the Brits would essentially stand pat on Huawei.

The UK ban transformed a colorful tactical skirmish in the US/China “trade spat” into a tectonic event. Suddenly (as per The Economist) we are at “the endgame.” It was noticed that Canada and Singapore have decided in favor of Ericsson and Nokia (even though they have not formally banned Huawei). And the French government, while not endorsing a ban, has advised the operators there to steer clear of Huawei. Germany is wobbly. Merkel hesitates, but members of almost every German political party are pushing for a ban – “If there were a vote in parliament today, Huawei would lose.” Telecom Italia also announced this month that it was excluding Huawei from its 5G tenders in Italy and Brazil. Not a good trend for Huawei. The Chinese are threatening to retaliate, perhaps by banning or restricting European competitors Ericsson and Nokia. Thus, it seems to some that Huawei’s take-down must portend a much larger shift in the global order, a “New Cold War.” There is overreaction here (where perhaps there was underreaction before). The Huawei episode is likely not an end but a beginning, a sign of what will become a long turnabout in world economic affairs. It is not plausible that the global trade network can operate for long “without trust.” Finance certainly can’t function without trust, and trade won’t run without finance. The investment process, the capital markets, are based on trust. We can go all the way back to 1913, to J.P. Morgan himself, called to testify on his business practices before a skeptical Congress. Towards the end of a long interrogation, when he was asked by the chief counsel for the House Banking Committee “Is not commercial credit primarily based on money or property?” – Morgan famously declared, 4/5/24, 12:41 AM Is The UK Ban On Huawei The ‘Endgame’ For Free Trade? https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2020/07/24/is-the-uk-ban-on-huawei-the-endgame-for-free-trade/?sh=472d004546db 5/6 Morgan spoke of trust as personal matter, rooted in the “character” of one’s counterparty. There were very few institutionalized forms of trust in his day. There were no financial reporting standards (no GAAP, no FASB), no true audited statements, no securities or banking regulators (no SEC, no FDIC). There was no central bank in the U.S. In fact Morgan was the Central Bank. We have spent the past century laboriously constructing the common framework to support trust in the financial system, systemic, structural trust, trust-worthy institutions, like the Dollar, the Federal Reserve, the stock exchange and all its plumbing, the system of financial regulation, modern accounting standards… The commercial contracts that enable the global trade process today rest upon these foundations. This is the framework that gives an investor, or a business executive, the confidence that a transaction here (in New York, say) will be honored in London, or Hong Kong, or Shenzhen, and vice versa. Trust is the name of the game today as much as it was in Morgan’s time. We have built the whole system to uphold and strengthen it, and to make it more fungible. We have made trust – which began as a handshake and an eye-to-eye connection – into a commodity, which the world can trade in confidence. It underpins our prosperity. The Economist will regain its composure. Beijing has some sorting out and reflecting to do. Over time, they will build the same framework of trust that the U.S. has assembled, and for the same reasons. “No sir, the first thing is character … before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it.… A man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom. I think that is the fundamental basis of business.” 4/5/24, 12:41 AM Is The UK Ban On Huawei The ‘Endgame’ For Free Trade? https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2020/07/24/is-the-uk-ban-on-huawei-the-endgame-for-free-trade/?sh=472d004546db 6/6 As for Huawei, their predicament – as dire as it seems right now – is in principle recoverable, as ZTE’s was. Not without a price, and with some obvious adjustments. Their basic problem is – in a word – a loss of trust. They have been careless with that most intangible, but most valuable, of all corporate assets. Still, recovery is possible. Unlike in Morgan’s day, the world is well stocked with institutions and mechanisms to create and validate trust and confidence. Trust today can be acquired, almost like any other commodity. Huawei has really only to avail itself of these resources.

Hackers backed by the Chinese government attempted to steal coronavirus vaccination data from US-based biotech company, Moderna Inc., a U.S. security official tracking Chinese hacking revealed in an exclusive Reuters report Friday.

China pushed back on this accusation and said, “Such allegations are pure slander.”

“Recently so-called sources from the US government have been accusing China of hacking to steal technology and data of U.S. vaccine research, but there has been no evidence whatsoever,” Wang Wenbin, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a press conference Friday.

Webin pointed to the fact that the intelligence sources were all anonymous.

“The international community can see through such vilifying ploys,” he said.

CHINA HITS US WITH BLAME FOR 'POISONED' RELATIONS WITH UK OVER FAILED HUAWEI DEAL

The spokesman said that China in fact is worried about potential hacking from foreign actors attempting to steal their data in the race to find a vaccination for the coronavirus.

“As we've repeatedly said, China is leading the world in COVID-19 vaccine research and development,” Webin told reporters Friday. “We don't need to get ahead by theft and we have never done that.”

The Justice Department (DOJ) indicted two Chinese nationals working for the Chinese intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), last week for alleged hacking U.S. and international systems.


“The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks,” the DOJ said in a statement on July 21.

DOJ CHARGES CHINESE HACKERS WITH TRYING TO STEAL US COVID-19 RESEARCH
“The defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments,"" the DOJ added.

According to the FBI, the hackers targeted vulnerabilities, placed malicious “web shell programs” and credential stealing software that allowed them to access victims computers remotely.

The suspects targeted eight victims affiliated with “technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures.”

The DOJ did not disclose the names of the victims or companies the hackers targeted.

But Moderna, who reportedly announced their COVID-19 vaccine candidacy in January, were contacted by the FBI and made aware of the suspected hacking, related to the indictment last week, according to Reuter’s report.

Moderna could not be immediately reached for comment.

The U.S. government has reportedly given Moderna nearly half a billion in funding to support their coronavirus research, making them one of the leading contenders in the U.S. and globally in finding a vaccine for the virus that has infected over 17 million and killed more than 677,000 people.

Hackers backed by the Chinese government attempted to steal coronavirus vaccination data from US-based biotech company, Moderna Inc., a U.S. security official tracking Chinese hacking revealed in an exclusive Reuters report Friday.

China pushed back on this accusation and said, “Such allegations are pure slander.”

“Recently so-called sources from the US government have been accusing China of hacking to steal technology and data of U.S. vaccine research, but there has been no evidence whatsoever,” Wang Wenbin, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a press conference Friday.

Webin pointed to the fact that the intelligence sources were all anonymous.

“The international community can see through such vilifying ploys,” he said.

CHINA HITS US WITH BLAME FOR 'POISONED' RELATIONS WITH UK OVER FAILED HUAWEI DEAL

The spokesman said that China in fact is worried about potential hacking from foreign actors attempting to steal their data in the race to find a vaccination for the coronavirus.

“As we've repeatedly said, China is leading the world in COVID-19 vaccine research and development,” Webin told reporters Friday. “We don't need to get ahead by theft and we have never done that.”

The Justice Department (DOJ) indicted two Chinese nationals working for the Chinese intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), last week for alleged hacking U.S. and international systems.


“The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks,” the DOJ said in a statement on July 21.

DOJ CHARGES CHINESE HACKERS WITH TRYING TO STEAL US COVID-19 RESEARCH
“The defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments,"" the DOJ added.

According to the FBI, the hackers targeted vulnerabilities, placed malicious “web shell programs” and credential stealing software that allowed them to access victims computers remotely.

The suspects targeted eight victims affiliated with “technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures.”

The DOJ did not disclose the names of the victims or companies the hackers targeted.

But Moderna, who reportedly announced their COVID-19 vaccine candidacy in January, were contacted by the FBI and made aware of the suspected hacking, related to the indictment last week, according to Reuter’s report.

Moderna could not be immediately reached for comment.

The U.S. government has reportedly given Moderna nearly half a billion in funding to support their coronavirus research, making them one of the leading contenders in the U.S. and globally in finding a vaccine for the virus that has infected over 17 million and killed more than 677,000 people.

Moderna is expected to launch a clinical trial this month on up to 30,000 people.

Trump ready to sanction China over Uighur oppression
Chinese companies are using a state-run labor program to force its mostly Muslim Uighur minorities into manufacturing masks and other personal protective equipment to keep up with increased demands during the coronavirus pandemic, an investigation by the New York Times said Sunday.

Though most of the gear purportedly produced through Uighur forced labor was distributed domestically, some Chinese companies that participated in the work transfer program also sent out shipments on the global market to countries, including the United States.

At least one shipment was sent to a medical supply company in Georgia from a factory in China’s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers were assigned, according to the Times.

The work transfer program involves shipping Uighur workers from their homes in the Xinjiang region to factories and other service jobs. They are required to learn Mandarin and pledge their allegiance to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies.

Before the pandemic struck, just four companies in Xinjiang made medical-grade protective equipment, according to China’s National Medical Products Administration. By June 20, at least 51 companies in the region produced medical-grade PPE. Of those 51, at least 17 participated in the state-run labor program involving Uighur workers, the Times reported, citing state media reports and public records.

Chinese state-run media has publicized the program as helping to lift Uighurs from poverty by giving them a form of employment and eliminating religious extremism. But penalties and quotas imposed by the Chines government suggest that participation in the program is involuntary.

This comes as British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Sunday accused Beijing of “gross and egregious” human rights abuses against its Uighur population in China’s western province of Xinjiang. Raab said that while Britain wants good relations with China, it could not stand by amid reports of forced sterilization and mass education camps targeting the Uighur population in Xinjiang.

“It is clear that there are gross, egregious human rights abuses going on. We are working with our international partners on this. It is deeply, deeply troubling,” he told the BBC.

Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador, denied during an interview with the BBC that there were concentration camps in Xinjiang and insisted there are “no so-called restriction of the population.” When confronted with drone footage that appeared to show Uighurs being blindfolded and led onto trains, Liu claimed there are many “fake accusations” against China.

Fox News Flash top headlines for July 14
A number of U.S. lawmakers have welcomed the U.K.’s decision to remove Huawei from the country’s 5G networks by 2027.

The move to oust the Chinese tech giant from 5G networks followed a technical review by the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Center in response to U.S. sanctions against Huawei.

“Technical experts at the NCSC reviewed the consequences of the sanctions and concluded the company will need to do a major reconfiguration of its supply chain as it will no longer have access to the technology on which it currently relies and there are no alternatives which we have sufficient confidence in,” said the U.K.’s Department of Culture, Media and Sport, in a statement released Tuesday. “They found the new restrictions make it impossible to continue to guarantee the security of Huawei equipment in the future.”

US ACCUSES HUAWEI OF SPYING ON MOBILE PHONE USERS

The decision comes amid security concerns fueled by rising tensions between Beijing and Western powers.

The U.S. had threatened to sever an intelligence-sharing arrangement with Britain because of concerns that Huawei’s involvement could allow the Chinese government to infiltrate U.K. networks.

Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was relieved the U.K. has initiated a plan to remove Huawei products from its communications systems.

“I have long been concerned about the national security risks posed by allowing high-risk vendors such as Huawei, and with them, the Chinese Communist Party, into any of our allies’ telecommunications infrastructure,” he said in a statement emailed to Fox News. “I know this has not been an easy decision to make, but it is the right one. As China continues to make clear its malign international intentions, I am heartened by the determination of Western allies to face these new challenges in a clear-eyed, unified manner.”

HUAWEI: CHINA WILL HIT BACK AT NEW US TRADE RESTRICTIONS

“The UK made the right call today to kick the Chinese Communist spy ring out of their network,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who is a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “The special relationship is stronger now, as are our joint efforts to expose the threats the CCP and their surveillance puppet pose to the free world. Thatcher would be proud.”

“The UK government’s decision is a step in the right direction, imposing limits on further Chinese spying on British communications,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., in a statement. “I urge London to remove completely the risk that Huawei 5G equipment poses to the privacy and security of its people.”

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chair of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, said that the U.K.’s move was a step in the right direction.

“I welcome these developments in the UK and reiterate my hope that the Trump Administration will begin to engage multilaterally with like-minded allies on promoting secure and competitively-priced alternatives to Huawei equipment,” he said in a statement emailed to Fox News. “My bipartisan legislation, the United Strategic Allied Telecommunications Act, would be a major step in the right direction and I hope to see it included, fully funded, in the eventual defense authorization act.”

GOP SENATOR CALLS TO 'STRANGLE' HUAWEI IN WAKE OF NEW SANCTIONS

President Donald Trump’s national security adviser also applauded Britain’s decision.

“The reported U.K. action reflects a growing international consensus that Huawei and other untrusted vendors pose a threat to national security, as they remain beholden to the Chinese Communist Party,” said Robert O’Brien, who is in Europe this week, in a statement. “We look forward to working with the U.K., as well as our many other partners and allies, to spur innovation, promote vendor diversity in the 5G supply chain, and ensure 5G security free from dangerous manipulations.”


Ed Brewster, a spokesman for Huawei UK, described the British government’s move as “bad news” for anyone in the U.K. with a mobile phone. “It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide,” he said in a statement.

“Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicized, this is about US trade policy and not security,” he added.

Sasse reacts after reports UK will freeze Huawei out of 5G networks
What Sen Ben Sasse is saying after reports reveal the UK will freeze Huawei out of 5G networks.

Britain announced Tuesday its decision to prohibit the Chinese telecommunication company Huawei, from playing a role in the U.K.’s access to the highspeed, 5G cellular network.

“With this decision, the U.K. joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday.

“We will continue to work with our British friends on fostering a secure and vibrant 5G ecosystem, which is critical to transatlantic security and prosperity.”

CHINA PLACES SANCTIONS ON LOCKHEED MARTIN OVER ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN

British officials said their decision to backtrack on Huawei plans was largely due to the U.S.’s sanctions that made it nearly impossible to ensure the security of the equipment being made.

The U.S. also warned that they would likely sever intelligence sharing if the U.K. adopted Huawei products, citing national security concerns relating to China’s capability for surveillance and monitoring of personal data and intelligence through the 5G network.


“Whether the U.K. will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses offers a telling clue to how the post-Brexit British market will perform and how secure China's investment will be in that country,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in a press conference Tuesday. “So, we will be closely following the situation.”

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden reportedly told Parliament Tuesday that the decision would likely delay and increase rollout costs in the U.K. by $2.5 billion.

CHINA ACCUSES US OF 'INCITING CONFRONTATION’ IN SOUTH CHINA SEA
“This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one,” he said.

The announcement will mean that all British telecom operators will be required to stop purchasing Huawei equipment by the end of this year. The companies have until 2027 to completely eliminate Huawei gear that has already been incorporated in their network, which is currently under construction.

The U.K. has joined the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Sweden in banning Huawei products from their future 5G networks.

“Clean carriers like Jio in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in South Korea, NTT in Japan, and others have also prohibited the use of Huawei equipment in their networks,” Pompeo said in his statement Tuesday.

5G is expected to increase the speed and accessibility of not only cellular services but is expected to usher in new changes to self-driving cars, rural surgeries and potentially, factory robots.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed in January to grant Huawei a limited role in the development of 5G in the U.K. Huawei was limited to providing just 35 percent of the equipment needed, so long as it was not a part of the core components of the system.

The U.S. imposed sanctions in May that barred any company from using American made machinery or software needed to create microchips for Huawei.

U.S. security officials have cited concerns that the Chinese government could demand access from the telecom company’s foreign networks that it would theoretically help to build, as in the case of Britain.

“Countries need to be able to trust that 5G equipment and software will not threaten national security, economic security, privacy, intellectual property, or human rights,” Pompeo said Tuesday.

Huawei U.K. Vice President Jeremy Thompson told The Associated Press that he thinks the decision will put “Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide.”

“The American motive for these activities is one of protecting American jobs,” Thompson said.

Sasse reacts after reports UK will freeze Huawei out of 5G networks
What Sen Ben Sasse is saying after reports reveal the UK will freeze Huawei out of 5G networks.

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., hailed reports that the United Kingdom is planning to freeze the Chinese telecom giant Huawei out of its 5G network by the end of the year, saying it's ""good for the British government"" to be giving Huawei the boot after months of pressure from the U.S.

The Sunday Times and The Daily Telegraph reported over the weekend that the U.K. would remove Huawei from its 5G infrastructure, and the Sunday Times reported the move would be complete ""by Christmas."" The United Kingdom's decision earlier this year to use Huawei to help build its 5G network sent American politicians into an uproar, with Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., saying ""Huawei has been and will continue to be a national security threat,"" and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., saying ""[t]he Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will now have a foothold to conduct pervasive espionage on British society.""

Now, as the U.K. is reportedly reversing its plans to use Huawei equipment – after a year of pressure from the U.S. to do otherwise – Sasse on Sunday voiced his support for the decision.

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO SANCTION CHINESE ENTITIES THAT MENACE HONG KONG, BANKS THAT WORK WITH THEM

""Chairman Xi’s spy web isn’t going to like this, but good for the British government,"" he said. ""Shared security interests are a major part of our special relationship with the Brits, and the Chinese Communist Party’s tech puppet should not be allowed to sit on our closest ally’s networks.""

The foreign policy victory for the United States comes as American officials are trying to fight back against a propaganda war from the Chinese government over the coronavirus, which Beijing has incorrectly said originated with the U.S. Army. It also comes as the two countries are engaged in military posturing in the South China Sea, trade tensions continue and both nations scramble to gain the upper hand in a 21st-century version of the space race.

China's pervasive human rights abuses and crackdowns against free speech, particularly with a new ""national security"" law passed last week aimed at pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, also complicate the relationship between the U.S. and China — two countries with extensive economic ties. The State Department last week started warning American companies against working with Chinese companies that are ""literally using slave labor.""

Sasse and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., two lawmakers who are almost constantly at odds, jointly led a letter in March urging the United Kingdom's government to reconsider its Huawei decision. The letter included the signatures of 20 total senators ranging from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

""Given the significant security, privacy, and economic threats posed by Huawei, we strongly urge the United Kingdom to revisit its recent decision, take steps to mitigate the risks of Huawei, and work in close partnership with the U.S. on such efforts going forward,"" the senators wrote.

They added: ""Notably, the U.K. government itself has warned that Huawei’s telecommunications equipment raises “significant” security issues. Through China’s patchwork of vague intelligence, national security, and cybersecurity laws, Chinese companies are compelled to support and cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party’s intelligence-gathering authorities.""

The Trump administration has also railed against Huawei being allowed into the United Kingdom and the company's ties to the CCP in general.

As the U.S. imposed rules preventing Huawei from accessing American technology in May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Huawei ""a tool of the Chinese Communist Party, beholden to its orders.""

The head of Britain’s cyber-intelligence agency on Tuesday accused China of trying to ""rewrite the rules of international security,"" saying Beijing is using its economic and technological clout to clamp down at home and exert control abroad.

Jeremy Fleming, director of GCHQ, said that despite war raging in Europe since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Beijing’s growing power is ""the national security issue that will define our future.""

In a rare public speech to the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Fleming alleged that Beijing’s Communist authorities want to ""gain strategic advantage by shaping the world’s technology ecosystem.""

""When it comes to technology, the politically motivated actions of the Chinese state is an increasingly urgent problem we must acknowledge and address,"" Fleming said. ""That’s because it’s changing the definition of national security into a much broader concept. Technology has become not just an area for opportunity, for competition and collaboration, it’s a battleground for control, values and influence.""

In a rare public speech Tuesday, Oct. 11, 2022 to the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Fleming accused China of using its economic and technological clout to clamp down at home and exert control abroad, saying Beijing’s aggressive stance is driven by fear and poses ""a huge threat to us all.""

He argued that the one-party system in Beijing seeks to control China’s population and sees other countries ""as either potential adversaries or potential client states, to be threatened, bribed or coerced.""

Relations between Britain and China have grown increasingly frosty in recent years, with U.K. officials accusing Beijing of economic subterfuge and human rights abuses.

British spies have given increasingly negative assessments of Beijing’s influence and intentions. Last year the head of the MI6 overseas intelligence agency, Richard Moore, called China one of the biggest threats to Britain and its allies.

In 2020, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson followed the United States in banning Chinese tech firm Huawei as a security risk, ordering it to be stripped out of the U.K.’s 5G telecoms network by 2027.

Fleming warned that China is seeking to fragment the infrastructure of the internet to exert greater control. He also said China is seeking to use digital currencies used by central banks to snoop on users’ transactions and as a way of avoiding future international sanctions of the sort imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

Fleming argued that China’s BeiDou satellite system — an alternative to the widely used GPS navigation technology — could contain ""a powerful anti-satellite capability, with a doctrine of denying other nations access to space in the event of a conflict.""

Fleming warned that the world is approaching a ""sliding doors"" moment in history — a reference to the 1998 Gwyneth Paltrow film in which a woman’s fate hinges on a seemingly trivial moment.

He called on Western firms and researchers to toughen intellectual property protections and for democratic countries to develop alternatives that can prevent developing nations from ""mortgaging the future by buying into the Chinese vision for technology.""

He said the world’s democracies can't afford to fall behind in cutting-edge fields such as quantum computing, and warned of a potential weakness over semiconductors, the critical chips used in everyday electronics. Taiwan — which China regards as a breakaway province to be reclaimed by force if necessary — is a world leader in their production.

""Events in the Taiwan Straits — any risk to that vital supply chain — have the potential to directly impact the resilience of the U.K. and global future growth,"" Fleming said.

Fleming also addressed the war in Ukraine, saying Russia is running short of weapons and Ukraine’s ""courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide.""

""Russia’s forces are exhausted,"" he said. ""The use of prisoners to reinforce, and now the mobilization of tens of thousands of inexperienced conscripts, speaks of a desperate situation.""

UK reverses decision to give Huawei role in 5G development
A new bipartisan bill in the Senate will require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to hold off on clearing business requests from companies on the commission’s national security threat list, including the Chinese company Huawei.

Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ed Markey, D-Mass., introduced the Secure Equipment Act of 2021, a bill that aims to stop the FCC from reviewing and approving business applications from companies on the commission’s ""Covered List.""

According to a press release issued Monday, the bill would also ""prevent further integration and sales"" of ""Chinese state-backed or directed firms,"" such as Huawei and ZTE, in America ""regardless of whether federal funds are involved.""

Under current law, U.S. telecommunications carriers are only allowed to take down equipment purchased with federal funds, creating an exploitable loophole.

""Chinese state-directed companies like Huawei and ZTE pose a serious risk to our national security,"" Rubio said in the release. ""The Chinese Communist Party subsidizes these companies and exploits loopholes in our laws to allow malicious actors to sell compromised equipment and services in the U.S.

""The status quo is dangerous, and we need to act now to strengthen our national security and protect our critical infrastructure,"" the Florida Republican added.

Markey said in the statement that the U.S. ""must animate our technology with our values, especially in the 5G networks that are critical to our future economic prosperity.""

""That’s why our bipartisan legislation will make sure all of our devices and equipment are safe for consumers and secure for the United States,"" Markey continued. ""I’m proud to partner with Sen. Rubio on this commonsense proposal and I look forward to fighting together for its swift passage.""

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr applauded the two senators in the release for their ""leadership and bold action.""

SEN. BEN SASSE PRESSES ODNI NOMINEE OVER HIS WORK FOR HUAWEI

""Their legislation would strengthen our national security by ensuring that we close the loophole that Huawei and others are using right now despite our determination that their gear poses an unacceptable risk to our national security,"" Carr said.

According to the release, the FCC adopted new rules in 2020 requiring U.S. telecommunications companies to take down and replace equipment from Huawei and other companies that are on the commission’s Covered List.

,,,,,"New UK Prime Minister Liz Truss won't be 'afraid of picking a fight' with Biden, experts say
Experts say new UK prime minister could push back against Biden on Brexit, Iran issues
Tyler Olson By Tyler Olson Fox News

Former Thatcher aide on new prime minister favorite Liz Truss: 'Exactly what Britain needs'
New United Kingdom Prime Minister Liz Truss is likely to take a more forceful approach to British foreign policy — including with the U.S. — at a time of major geopolitical upheaval, experts tell Fox News Digital. 

Truss, an experienced Conservative Party official who's currently the foreign secretary, is expected to bring a hawkish stance on both Russia and China. She's also expected to emphasize the special relationship between the U.K. and the United States, as her predecessor Prime Minister Boris Johnson did.

But amid tension across the Atlantic over trade and Brexit issues, Truss might be willing to push back harder against the U.S. and President Biden on some issues.

""I don't think she's going to be afraid of picking a fight with Joe Biden over crucial areas of British national interest. She will stand up to the U.S. president where necessary,"" Nile Gardiner, a former adviser to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, told Fox News Digital. Gardiner now works for the conservative Heritage Foundation.

BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER LIZ TRUSS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 

""Liz Truss is a determined, feisty figure,"" John Kampfner, the executive director of the U.K. in the World Initiative for the British think tank Chatham House, told Fox News Digital. ""She's an ardent ideologue, she heaps praise on Margaret Thatcher, both in terms of her domestic policy and foreign policy.""

The most high profile split between Truss and Biden could be on Brexit and what's known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, which was negotiated with the European Union as part of Brexit. The agreement effectively leaves Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, in the European Union's single market, along with its neighbor the Republic of Ireland, an independent country. 

U.K. leaders want to renegotiate this deal because, they say, it erodes the standing of Northern Ireland within the U.K. But European Union leaders — and some in Washington — oppose such a move, arguing it could risk undermining more than two decades of peace between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Kampfner said Truss has made very clear where she stands on the Northern Ireland Protocol — and will be fundamentally at odds with Biden.

""She will antagonize the Biden administration in her approach to Northern Ireland and Europe,"" Kampfner said of Truss.

""The White House has been very unhelpful over Northern Ireland, and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, has made several threats to Great Britain in terms of sinking a U.S-U.K trade deal because of the Northern Ireland issue."" Gardiner said. ""I expect that Liz Truss is going to be more assertive in her dealings with Joe Biden than Boris Johnson.""

Another area of potential dissent between Truss and Biden could be the U.S. administration's efforts to renegotiate a nuclear deal with Iran. 

Biden was the vice president when the U.S. agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with several other countries, including the U.K., aimed at limiting Iranian nuclear ambitions while easing sanctions on the rogue state. Former President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal after taking office, reinstating sanctions. And Biden's administration has made a new deal a priority since taking office. 

Truss hasn't yet taken a firm stance on renewed negotiations. But some in Truss' Conservative Party are sour on the idea of the negotiations, Gardiner said, raising ""the possibility that you see a break from where the U.S. is at the moment.""

Kampfner, meanwhile, predicted that Truss may seek flexibility on the Iran issue to avoid stoking divisions with the U.S. on more fronts than she needs to.

China could also be an area of disconnect between Truss and the Biden administration, Kampfner said, despite the fact both countries are moving toward more hawkish stances on the Asian nation. 

""She is very tough on China,"" Kampfner said. ""Britain called China a ‘systemic competitor.’ And she wants to call it an ‘acute threat,’ which is quite some step. Does that go too far for the Biden administration?""

""Under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May, the U.K sought to build stronger economic relationships with China,"" Gardiner said. ""Which in the case of Chinese telecommunications companies, such as Huawei for example, threatened national security. So Liz Truss is in favor of a much more robust approach toward China.""

Truss' hawkishness also extends to Russia and beyond, according to Kampfner, who said the new prime minister seeks to shake up the way international organizations do business in the 21st century. Whether that is successful, he said, remains to be seen. 


""She is portraying herself as a disrupter in chief in a disrupted world. … She sees all these multinational institutions, and she considers them to be stuck or to be atrophied or to be bust,"" Kampfner said. ""She's kind of marketing herself as what Uber did to transportation, she wants to do for public diplomacy.""

He added: ""It sounds interesting. Whether or not you can do that when you need to invest long term in partnerships, and relationships, and when you're a medium-sized country… I think she will end up by tempering… her really quite ultra-radical stance.""",,,,,,,,,new uk prime minister liz truss wont afraid picking fight biden expert say expert say new uk prime minister could push back biden brexit iran issue tyler olson tyler olson fox news published september pm former thatcher aide new prime minister favorite liz truss exactly britain need new united kingdom prime minister liz truss likely take forceful approach british foreign policy including u time major geopolitical upheaval expert tell fox news digital truss experienced conservative party official who currently foreign secretary expected bring hawkish stance russia china shes also expected emphasize special relationship uk united state predecessor prime minister boris johnson amid tension across atlantic trade brexit issue truss might willing push back harder u president biden issue dont think shes going afraid picking fight joe biden crucial area british national interest stand u president necessary nile gardiner former adviser former british prime minister margaret thatcher told fox news digital gardiner work conservative heritage foundation liz truss podium conservative party member british foreign secretary liz truss next prime minister united kingdom ap photofrank augstein britain prime minister liz truss need know liz truss determined feisty figure john kampfner executive director uk world initiative british think tank chatham house told fox news digital shes ardent ideologue heap praise margaret thatcher term domestic policy foreign policy high profile split truss biden could brexit whats known northern ireland protocol negotiated european union part brexit agreement effectively leaf northern ireland part united kingdom european union single market along neighbor republic ireland independent country uk leader want renegotiate deal say erodes standing northern ireland within uk european union leader washington oppose move arguing could risk undermining two decade peace ireland northern ireland kampfner said truss made clear stand northern ireland protocol fundamentally odds biden antagonize biden administration approach northern ireland europe kampfner said truss president biden speaks front two microphone suit president biden said support european union great britain dispute northern ireland protocol ap photodamian dovarganes white house unhelpful northern ireland nancy pelosi speaker house made several threat great britain term sinking usuk trade deal northern ireland issue gardiner said expect liz truss going assertive dealing joe biden boris johnson uk prime minister election see liz truss victory rival rishi sunak another area potential dissent truss biden could u administration effort renegotiate nuclear deal iran biden vice president u agreed joint comprehensive plan action jcpoa several country including uk aimed limiting iranian nuclear ambition easing sanction rogue state former president donald trump withdrew deal taking office reinstating sanction bidens administration made new deal priority since taking office truss hasnt yet taken firm stance renewed negotiation truss conservative party sour idea negotiation gardiner said raising possibility see break u moment kampfner meanwhile predicted truss may seek flexibility iran issue avoid stoking division u front need liz truss waving liz truss great britain next prime minister take office tuesday audience queen ap photokirsty wigglesworth british pub owner face murky future energy price skyrocket soul destroying china could also area disconnect truss biden administration kampfner said despite fact country moving toward hawkish stance asian nation tough china kampfner said britain called china systemic competitor want call acute threat quite step go far biden administration tony blair gordon brown david cameron theresa may uk sought build stronger economic relationship china gardiner said case chinese telecommunication company huawei example threatened national security liz truss favor much robust approach toward china truss hawkishness also extends russia beyond according kampfner said new prime minister seek shake way international organization business st century whether successful said remains seen portraying disrupter chief disrupted world see multinational institution considers stuck atrophied bust kampfner said shes kind marketing uber transportation want public diplomacy added sound interesting whether need invest long term partnership relationship youre mediumsized country think end tempering really quite ultraradical stance

Pompeo says U.S. initiative turning countries away from Chinese giant tech is working

Secretary Pompeo tells Senate Foreign Relations Committee 'the tide is turning' on China
Secretary Pompeo testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing for the State Department's FY21 budget.

China is placing blame squarely on the U.S. for failed plans between the U.K. and the Chinese tech company Huawei, on plans to develop 5G.

China’s ambassador to the U.K., Liu Xiaoming, said that London’s decision to reverse previously agreed upon plans to grant Huawei a leading role in their development of 5G was ""seriously poisoning"" the U.K.-China relationship, Sky News reported Thursday.


Liu said that the U.K. is attempting to interfere with the internal affairs of the Chinese government, by openly condemning the recent national security laws established in Hong Kong and their suspension of the extradition treaty.

UK REVERSES DECISION TO GIVE HUAWEI ROLE IN 5G DEVELOPMENT

He further accused the U.K. of confusing “right from wrong,” “recklessly” slandering “China’s Xinjiang-related policies” in regards to the Uighurs and calling their actions in Xinjiang a “so-called “human rights issue.”

Liu also warned the U.K. government against “Cold War” actors and their “remarks of anti-China forces in and outside the UK,” alluding to the Trump administration who has been vocal in their disapproval of China’s actions regarding the coronavirus, the race to 5G and reported human rights abuses committed against the Uighur population.

Another Chinese official condemned the U.S.’s actions in persuading countries not to allow Huawei to assist in their development of 5G.

“The real reason behind Pompeo's animosity towards Chinese companies has nothing to do with national security or democracy, freedoms, fairness or reciprocity,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Thursday.

“It's just because they are Chinese companies and also frontrunners in their lines of business.”

U.S. security officials, largely led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have cited concerns regarding the Chinese government’s potential ability to demand access from the Huawei’s foreign networks that the telecom company would theoretically have had a hand in building.

POMPEO TELLS LAWMAKERS THE ‘TIDE IS TURNING’ AGAINST CHINA
“Countries need to be able to trust that 5G equipment and software will not threaten national security, economic security, privacy, intellectual property, or human rights,” Pompeo said in a press conference just days before the U.K. rescinded their agreement with Huawei.


Chinese officials are not incorrect in blaming the U.S. government for the U.K.’s change of heart.

British officials said that their decision was largely based on pressure from the U.S. and sanctions that made it difficult for countries to ensure the security of equipment being developed.

The U.S. had also threatened to sever intelligence sharing if the U.K. proceeded with Huawei, citing security concerns relating to China’s potential surveillance and monitoring capabilities.

“Pompeo has been claiming that by excluding Huawei, countries are joining the ranks of ‘clean countries’,” Wenbin said Thursday. “The so-called ""clean countries"" he has been touting is nothing but a code name of double standards.”

The U.K. along with Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Sweden have heeded Pompeo’s warnings of potential security threats and banned all Huawei products from future 5G networks.

“Our vigorous diplomacy has helped lead an international awakening to the threat of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party). Senators, the tide is turning,” Pompeo said in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Thursday, while explaining that countries around the globe are supporting U.S. initiatives in preventing the Chinese tech giant from developing further.",,,,,,,,,china hit u blame poisoned relation uk failed huawei deal pompeo say u initiative turning country away chinese giant tech working caitlin mcfall fox news published july pm edt facebook twitter flipboard comment print email secretary pompeo tell senate foreign relation committee tide turning china secretary pompeo testifies senate foreign relation committee hearing state department fy budget china placing blame squarely u failed plan uk chinese tech company huawei plan develop g china ambassador uk liu xiaoming said london decision reverse previously agreed upon plan grant huawei leading role development g seriously poisoning ukchina relationship sky news reported thursday liu said uk attempting interfere internal affair chinese government openly condemning recent national security law established hong kong suspension extradition treaty uk revers decision give huawei role g development accused uk confusing right wrong recklessly slandering china xinjiangrelated policy regard uighur calling action xinjiang socalled human right issue liu also warned uk government cold war actor remark antichina force outside uk alluding trump administration vocal disapproval china action regarding coronavirus race g reported human right abuse committed uighur population another chinese official condemned us action persuading country allow huawei assist development g real reason behind pompeos animosity towards chinese company nothing national security democracy freedom fairness reciprocity chinese foreign ministry spokesperson wang wenbin told reporter thursday chinese company also frontrunners line business u security official largely led secretary state mike pompeo cited concern regarding chinese government potential ability demand access huaweis foreign network telecom company would theoretically hand building pompeo tell lawmaker tide turning china country need able trust g equipment software threaten national security economic security privacy intellectual property human right pompeo said press conference day uk rescinded agreement huawei chinese official incorrect blaming u government uk change heart british official said decision largely based pressure u sanction made difficult country ensure security equipment developed u also threatened sever intelligence sharing uk proceeded huawei citing security concern relating china potential surveillance monitoring capability pompeo claiming excluding huawei country joining rank clean country wenbin said thursday socalled clean country touting nothing code name double standard click get fox news app uk along czech republic denmark estonia latvia poland romania sweden heeded pompeos warning potential security threat banned huawei product future g network vigorous diplomacy helped lead international awakening threat ccp chinese communist party senator tide turning pompeo said senate foreign relation committee hearing thursday explaining country around globe supporting u initiative preventing chinese tech giant developing

A number of U.S. lawmakers have welcomed the U.K.’s decision to remove Huawei from the country’s 5G networks by 2027.

The move to oust the Chinese tech giant from 5G networks followed a technical review by the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Center in response to U.S. sanctions against Huawei.

“Technical experts at the NCSC reviewed the consequences of the sanctions and concluded the company will need to do a major reconfiguration of its supply chain as it will no longer have access to the technology on which it currently relies and there are no alternatives which we have sufficient confidence in,” said the U.K.’s Department of Culture, Media and Sport, in a statement released Tuesday. “They found the new restrictions make it impossible to continue to guarantee the security of Huawei equipment in the future.”

US ACCUSES HUAWEI OF SPYING ON MOBILE PHONE USERS

The decision comes amid security concerns fueled by rising tensions between Beijing and Western powers.

The U.S. had threatened to sever an intelligence-sharing arrangement with Britain because of concerns that Huawei’s involvement could allow the Chinese government to infiltrate U.K. networks.

Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was relieved the U.K. has initiated a plan to remove Huawei products from its communications systems.

“I have long been concerned about the national security risks posed by allowing high-risk vendors such as Huawei, and with them, the Chinese Communist Party, into any of our allies’ telecommunications infrastructure,” he said in a statement emailed to Fox News. “I know this has not been an easy decision to make, but it is the right one. As China continues to make clear its malign international intentions, I am heartened by the determination of Western allies to face these new challenges in a clear-eyed, unified manner.”

HUAWEI: CHINA WILL HIT BACK AT NEW US TRADE RESTRICTIONS

“The UK made the right call today to kick the Chinese Communist spy ring out of their network,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who is a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “The special relationship is stronger now, as are our joint efforts to expose the threats the CCP and their surveillance puppet pose to the free world. Thatcher would be proud.”

“The UK government’s decision is a step in the right direction, imposing limits on further Chinese spying on British communications,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., in a statement. “I urge London to remove completely the risk that Huawei 5G equipment poses to the privacy and security of its people.”

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chair of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, said that the U.K.’s move was a step in the right direction.

“I welcome these developments in the UK and reiterate my hope that the Trump Administration will begin to engage multilaterally with like-minded allies on promoting secure and competitively-priced alternatives to Huawei equipment,” he said in a statement emailed to Fox News. “My bipartisan legislation, the United Strategic Allied Telecommunications Act, would be a major step in the right direction and I hope to see it included, fully funded, in the eventual defense authorization act.”

GOP SENATOR CALLS TO 'STRANGLE' HUAWEI IN WAKE OF NEW SANCTIONS

President Donald Trump’s national security adviser also applauded Britain’s decision.

“The reported U.K. action reflects a growing international consensus that Huawei and other untrusted vendors pose a threat to national security, as they remain beholden to the Chinese Communist Party,” said Robert O’Brien, who is in Europe this week, in a statement. “We look forward to working with the U.K., as well as our many other partners and allies, to spur innovation, promote vendor diversity in the 5G supply chain, and ensure 5G security free from dangerous manipulations.”


Ed Brewster, a spokesman for Huawei UK, described the British government’s move as “bad news” for anyone in the U.K. with a mobile phone. “It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide,” he said in a statement.

Sasse reacts after reports UK will freeze Huawei out of 5G networks
Britain announced Tuesday its decision to prohibit the Chinese telecommunication company Huawei, from playing a role in the U.K.’s access to the highspeed, 5G cellular network.

“With this decision, the U.K. joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday.

“We will continue to work with our British friends on fostering a secure and vibrant 5G ecosystem, which is critical to transatlantic security and prosperity.”

CHINA PLACES SANCTIONS ON LOCKHEED MARTIN OVER ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN

British officials said their decision to backtrack on Huawei plans was largely due to the U.S.’s sanctions that made it nearly impossible to ensure the security of the equipment being made.

The U.S. also warned that they would likely sever intelligence sharing if the U.K. adopted Huawei products, citing national security concerns relating to China’s capability for surveillance and monitoring of personal data and intelligence through the 5G network.


“Whether the U.K. will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses offers a telling clue to how the post-Brexit British market will perform and how secure China's investment will be in that country,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in a press conference Tuesday. “So, we will be closely following the situation.”

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden reportedly told Parliament Tuesday that the decision would likely delay and increase rollout costs in the U.K. by $2.5 billion.

“This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one,” he said.

The announcement will mean that all British telecom operators will be required to stop purchasing Huawei equipment by the end of this year. The companies have until 2027 to completely eliminate Huawei gear that has already been incorporated in their network, which is currently under construction.

The U.K. has joined the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Sweden in banning Huawei products from their future 5G networks.

“Clean carriers like Jio in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in South Korea, NTT in Japan, and others have also prohibited the use of Huawei equipment in their networks,” Pompeo said in his statement Tuesday.

5G is expected to increase the speed and accessibility of not only cellular services but is expected to usher in new changes to self-driving cars, rural surgeries and potentially, factory robots.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed in January to grant Huawei a limited role in the development of 5G in the U.K. Huawei was limited to providing just 35 percent of the equipment needed, so long as it was not a part of the core components of the system.

The U.S. imposed sanctions in May that barred any company from using American made machinery or software needed to create microchips for Huawei.

U.S. security officials have cited concerns that the Chinese government could demand access from the telecom company’s foreign networks that it would theoretically help to build, as in the case of Britain.

“Countries need to be able to trust that 5G equipment and software will not threaten national security, economic security, privacy, intellectual property, or human rights,” Pompeo said Tuesday.

Huawei U.K. Vice President Jeremy Thompson told The Associated Press that he thinks the decision will put “Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide.”

“The American motive for these activities is one of protecting American jobs,” Thompson said.",,,,,,,,,uk revers decision give huawei role g development chinese official say britain decision reflective postbrexit market preform caitlin mcfall fox news published july pm edt facebook twitter flipboard comment print email close sasse reacts report uk freeze huawei g network britain announced tuesday decision prohibit chinese telecommunication company huawei playing role uk access highspeed g cellular network decision uk join growing list country around world standing national security prohibiting use untrusted highrisk vendor u secretary state mike pompeo said tuesday continue work british friend fostering secure vibrant g ecosystem critical transatlantic security prosperity china place sanction lockheed martin arm sale taiwan british official said decision backtrack huawei plan largely due us sanction made nearly impossible ensure security equipment made u also warned would likely sever intelligence sharing uk adopted huawei product citing national security concern relating china capability surveillance monitoring personal data intelligence g network whether uk provide open fair nondiscriminatory environment chinese business offer telling clue postbrexit british market perform secure china investment country foreign ministry spokesperson zhao lijian said press conference tuesday closely following situation culture secretary oliver dowden reportedly told parliament tuesday decision would likely delay increase rollout cost uk billion china accuses u inciting confrontation south china sea easy decision right one said announcement mean british telecom operator required stop purchasing huawei equipment end year company completely eliminate huawei gear already incorporated network currently construction uk joined czech republic denmark estonia latvia poland romania sweden banning huawei product future g network clean carrier like jio india telstra australia sk kt south korea ntt japan others also prohibited use huawei equipment network pompeo said statement tuesday g expected increase speed accessibility cellular service expected usher new change selfdriving car rural surgery potentially factory robot prime minister boris johnson agreed january grant huawei limited role development g uk huawei limited providing percent equipment needed long part core component system u imposed sanction may barred company using american made machinery software needed create microchip huawei click get fox news app u security official cited concern chinese government could demand access telecom company foreign network would theoretically help build case britain country need able trust g equipment software threaten national security economic security privacy intellectual property human right pompeo said tuesday huawei uk vice president jeremy thompson told associated press think decision put britain digital slow lane push bill deepen digital divide american motive activity one protecting american job thompson said

Britain Bars Huawei From 5G Network Over Security Concerns
The British government said that it would ban the purchase of new Huawei equipment for 5G networks, escalating tensions with China.
The new U.S. measures restrict Huawei’s ability to produce important products using U.S. technology or software. The National Cybersecurity Center has reviewed the consequences of the U.S.’s actions. The N.C.C. has now reported to ministers that they have significantly changed their security assessment of Huawei’s presence in the U.K.’s 5G network. Given the uncertainty that this creates around Huawei’s supply chain, the U.K. can no longer be confident it will be able to guarantee the security of future 5G — Huawei 5G equipment — affected by the change in U.S. foreign direct product rules. The government agrees with the National Cybersecurity Center’s advice. The best way to secure our networks is for operators to stop using new affected Huawei equipment to build the U.K.’s future 5G networks. This will delay our rollout of 5G. Our decisions in January had already set back that rollout by a year and cost up to a billion pounds. Today’s decision to ban the procurement of new Huawei 5G equipment from the end of this year will delay rollout by a further year, and will add up to half a billion pounds to costs. This means a cumulative delay to 5G rollout of two to three years and costs of up to 2 billion pounds. This will have real consequences for the connections on which all our constituents rely.

LONDON — Britain announced on Tuesday that it would ban equipment from the Chinese technology giant Huawei from the country’s high-speed wireless network, a victory for the Trump administration that escalates the battle between Western powers and China over critical technology.

The move reverses a decision in January, when Britain said Huawei equipment could be used in its new 5G network on a limited basis. Since then, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced growing political pressure domestically to take a harder line against Beijing, and in May, the United States imposed new restrictions to disrupt Huawei’s access to important components.

Britain’s about-face signals a new willingness among Western countries to confront China, a determination that has grown firmer since Beijing last month adopted a sweeping law to tighten its grip on Hong Kong, the semiautonomous city that was a British colony until 1997. On Tuesday, Robert O’Brien, President Trump’s national security adviser, was in Paris for meetings about China with counterparts from Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

Huawei’s critics say its close ties to the Chinese government mean Beijing could use the equipment for espionage or to disrupt telecommunications — a point the company strongly disputes.

Arguing that Huawei created too much risk for such a critical, multibillion-dollar project, the British government said Tuesday that it would ban the purchase of new Huawei equipment for 5G networks after December, and that existing gear already installed would need to be removed from the networks by 2027.

“As facts have changed, so has our approach,” Oliver Dowden, the government minister in charge of telecommunications, told the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon. “This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the U.K.’s telecoms networks, for our national security and our economy, both now and indeed in the long run.”

After the British government announced its decision, President Trump took aim at Huawei during a news conference at the White House, saying the United States has “confronted untrustworthy Chinese technology and telecom providers.”

“We convinced many countries, and I did this myself for the most part, not to use Huawei, because we think it’s an unsafe security risk,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump also announced that he was issuing an executive order formalizing a declaration from late May that the United States would treat Hong Kong in the same manner as China rather than as a semiautonomous territory and would impose the same tariffs that it applies to China. He also said he was signing into law a bipartisan congressional bill that encourages sanctions against Chinese officials and entities that take part in the repression of Hong Kong, as well as financial institutions that do business with those parties.

The dispute over Huawei, the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment, is an early front in a new tech cold war, with ramifications for internet freedom and surveillance, as well as emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics.

‘IDEOLOGICAL SPIRAL’As the United States and China clash over technology, territory and clout, a new geopolitical era is dawning.
“The democratic West has woken up late to its overdependence on a country whose values are diametrically opposed to it,” said Robert Hannigan, a former head of the British digital surveillance agency GCHQ, who is now an executive at the cybersecurity firm BlueVoyant. “Huawei and other Chinese companies present a real cybersecurity risk, but the primary threat comes from the intent of the Chinese Communist Party, as we see in Hong Kong.”

Huawei described the announcement on Tuesday as a disappointment and “bad news for anyone in the U.K. with a mobile phone.”

Relations Between China and the U.S.

“It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane,” said Ed Brewster, a spokesman for Huawei U.K. “Regrettably our future in the U.K. has become politicized; this is about U.S. trade policy and not security. ”

Until the latest turn of events, Britain had been welcoming of Huawei. In 2005, it was the first country to offer Huawei a foothold in Europe, now the company’s largest market outside China. Huawei financed university research and a charity started by Prince Charles. And just last month, Huawei announced plans to spend 1 billion pounds (about $1.25 billion) on a new research center in Cambridge.

The British experience shows the challenges nations face navigating the United States-China rift. In moving forward with the ban, Britain risks retaliation from China, one of its largest and fastest-growing trading partners, when it is trying to craft a more open trade policy outside the European Union. China’s ambassador in London, Liu Xiaoming, recently warned that Britain would “bear the consequences” of treating China with hostility.

“The Huawei issue is the first of many complicated decisions we’re going to have about striking the right balance between our commercial and economic engagement with China, and our security concerns about how China uses its power,” said John Sawers, a former chief of the British intelligence service MI6.

Huawei is the leading provider for towers, masts and other critical equipment needed to build new wireless networks based on fifth-generation wireless technology, known as 5G.

New 5G networks are seen as essential infrastructure in an increasingly digital global economy. The networks will provide faster download speeds for phone users, but offer even more important potential for commercial applications in industries such as manufacturing, health care and transportation.

Huawei’s technological dominance in this field is viewed as a failure of industrial policy in the West. American authorities have spent more than a year pressuring allies to keep Huawei out of communications networks, warning that the company is a proxy for Beijing and a threat to national security. The Trump administration encouraged the use of other telecom equipment makers, including Sweden’s Ericsson and Finland’s Nokia.

At first, countries were resistant, unconvinced that Huawei posed a grave risk. Britain argued that it had a security system in place to ensure all Huawei equipment was reviewed before being put inside its communications networks. The announcement in January stipulated Huawei would be limited to “noncore” parts of the network.

A turning point came in May, when the Trump administration announced a rule that would bar Huawei and its suppliers from using American technology and software. The decision, slated to take effect in September, could throw Huawei’s supply chain into chaos.

In Britain, the American announcement added to pressure Mr. Johnson faced from members of his own Conservative Party to take a harder line against China, especially after the events in Hong Kong. The government announced a review of its January decision after the American punishments were announced.

“American sanctions left the U.K. with little choice,” said Priya Guha, a former British diplomat who represented the country’s interests in Silicon Valley. “There was a bit of checkmate by the U.S.”

The Trump administration has taken other steps, some conducted with little publicity, to undercut China’s position in communications networks.

The U.S. government on Tuesday published an interim rule that will bar Pentagon and NASA contractors from using technology from Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies. Some government contractors say the ban, passed into law two years ago, is too onerous, and the administration estimates it will cost some $12 billion.

In April, a group of agencies that calls itself Team Telecom, led by the Justice Department, moved to remove China Telecom, another big wireless company, from its operations inside the United States. It has long been operating “points of presence” in U.S. networks that help maintain internet connections. In a series of classified briefings, American intelligence agencies accused it of experimenting with rerouting American traffic through China — though the purpose of that rerouting was unclear.

The same group moved last month to block the Pacific Light Cable Network — a partnership involving Facebook and Google among others — from operating an undersea cable linking Hong Kong and the United States, in what was supposed to be the highest-capacity undersea Pacific connection for internet traffic.

The Trump administration asked the Federal Communications Commission to block the connection in Hong Kong, citing concern it “would expose U.S. communications traffic to collection” by China, through a Chinese firm operating where the cable landed. Instead, it wants the commission to approve only direct connections to Taiwan and the Philippines, undercutting China’s effort to make Hong Kong a key data transfer hub. It cited the new national security law for Hong Kong, which at the time was still being drafted.

But it remains unclear if the steps involving Huawei and others will achieve Washington’s objective. Chinese firms will still control much of Asia’s traffic, and that means calls, data and searches will still move through Chinese switching systems. At best, the U.S. moves can make it harder for China’s leaders to cut off communications in times of conflict. But it cannot protect the United States from what Sue Gordon, the former deputy director of national intelligence, called the process of “living in a dirty network.”

Still, Robert B. Blair, a senior Commerce Department official who until recently served as the Trump White House’s chief telecommunications adviser, told a meeting of the Council on Foreign Relations on Tuesday that “we scored a major victory” with Britain’s decision.

In Britain, officials warned its ban would add significant costs, and delay the rollout of 5G by around two years. The new 5G wireless systems must be built atop existing networks that Huawei had a major role in constructing. In setting a 2027 deadline, the British government said moving any faster to remove Huawei gear would produce a greater risk to the security and resilience of the network.

The ban does not apply to smartphones and other consumer products made by Huawei, or equipment used in 2G, 3G and 4G networks.

Many see the Huawei dispute as foreshadowing future conflicts, with other prominent companies becoming entangled. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was considering actions against Chinese apps, including the hugely popular social media service TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese internet company.

Britain’s decision to bar Huawei will put pressure on other European countries. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is being urged to keep the company out of a new 5G network, but is weighing the economic fallout for German automakers, for whom China is a critical market.

“If Huawei is stopped in its tracks, that does represent a very important inflection point for China’s ability to achieve its objectives,” said Nigel Inkster, a senior adviser at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London who has written a book on the technology battle between the United States and China.

Mr. Inkster warned that the West risks provoking China if it feels more economically isolated. “There is a serious need to think hard and deeply about whether it is realistic to disengage from China totally in these areas,” he said.",,,,,,,,,uk bar huawei g tech battle china west escalates banning use chinese tech giant equipment highspeed wireless infrastructure major reversal prime minister

A top British intelligence official will warn in a speech on Tuesday that while Russia’s aggression has created an urgent threat, China’s expanding use of technology to control dissent and its growing ability to attack satellite systems, control digital currencies and track individuals pose far deeper challenges for the West.

In an interview on Monday ahead of his address, the official, Jeremy Fleming, who heads GCHQ — the British electronic intelligence-gathering and cyber agency made famous for its role in breaking the Enigma codes in World War II — also said he was skeptical about how far China would go to support Russia’s aggression.

“I don’t think that this is a ‘relationship without limits,’” he said, using the term that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China employed when they met at the Beijing Olympics early this year, just before the invasion of Ukraine. In light of Russia’s dismal battlefield performance and its brutality, he said, China “needs to be weighing up the advantages and disadvantage of continuing to align themselves strongly with Russia.”

Mr. Fleming’s agency — formally called Government Communications Headquarters, the counterpart to the National Security Agency in the United States — plays an increasingly central role in tracking Russian communications and preparing for the day when China’s advances in quantum computing may defeat the kinds of encryption used to protect both government and corporate communications.

A three-decade veteran of the British intelligence services, Mr. Fleming rarely speaks in public. But in recent months, several of Britain’s spy chiefs have deliberately taken a carefully crafted public role in describing future security threats.

Mr. Fleming has gone further, detailing the capabilities and rules surrounding Britain’s use of offensive cyber capabilities, which it employed in Syria against terror groups and reportedly against Russian forces in Ukraine, a subject Mr. Fleming declined to discuss.

Yet in the interview, he described Russia as “a disrupter” that was “unpredictable in its actions at the moment.” But he said the performance of Russia’s military had revealed deep weaknesses, and excerpts from his forthcoming speech describe Mr. Putin’s decision-making as “flawed,” its forces as “exhausted” and its reliance on mobilizing 300,000 “inexperienced conscripts” as evidence of Mr. Putin’s “desperate situation.”

“The Russian population has started to understand that, too,” he argued. “They’re seeing just how badly Putin has misjudged the situation.”

He added, “They’re fleeing the draft, knowing their access to modern technologies and external influences will be drastically restricted.”

But Mr. Fleming’s warning is another reminder of the speed at which the Western allies have come to view themselves as in direct competition, and sometimes in conflict, with both of the world’s other major nuclear superpowers. Of the two, he clearly regards Russia as the more manageable.

Until recent years, most European nations have been muted in their public critiques of Beijing and its ambitions, because trade with China became critical to growth, especially for Germany. Britain even permitted Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that the United States fears could pose a security threat, to provide some 5G equipment to Britain’s communications network — under some strict conditions — until sanctions imposed on the company by the United States made that impossible.

Mr. Fleming’s warnings about the strategies behind China’s investment in new technologies, and its effort to create “client economies and governments,” sound much like speeches given by his American counterparts for the past five or more years. But he spoke just before the opening of a Communist Party congress starting in Beijing on Sunday at which Xi Jinping is expected to be named to a third five-year term as the country’s top leader.

Mr. Fleming said that in the case of China, this could be “the sliding-doors moment in history,” in which the United States and its allies may soon discover that they are too far behind in a series of critical technologies to maintain a military or technological edge over Beijing.

He described China’s move to develop central bank digital currencies that could be used to track transactions as a shift that could also “enable China to partially evade the sort of international sanctions currently being applied to Putin’s regime in Russia.” He said that was one example of how China was “learning the lessons” from the war in Ukraine, presumably to apply them if it decided to move against Taiwan and prompted further efforts by the U.S. and its allies to isolate it economically.

Mr. Fleming also described China’s moves to build “a powerful antisatellite capability, with a doctrine of denying other nations access to space in the event of a conflict.” And he accused China of trying to alter international technology standards to ease the tracking of individuals, part of its effort to repress dissent, even the speech of Chinese citizens living abroad.

But his biggest warning surrounded dependence on Chinese companies that are closely linked to the state, or that would have no choice but to turn over data on individuals upon demand by the Chinese authorities. The Huawei experience, he said in the interview, “opened our eyes to the extent to which even the biggest businesses in China are ultimately wrapped up with the Chinese state” and have no choice but to comply “because of the way in which the Communist Party works and the national security laws operate.”

Yet in the Huawei case, the United States and its European partners have yet to offer truly competitive alternatives for much of the company’s networking equipment, officials from many countries say. “We have to be able to provide alternatives,” Mr. Fleming said. When pressed on whether Europe and the United States had provided those alternatives in the years since the campaign against Huawei gained traction, he acknowledged, “No, we don’t.”

Last week, the Biden administration announced sweeping new limits on the sale of semiconductor technology to China, hoping to cripple Beijing’s access to critical technologies that are needed for supercomputers, advanced weapons and artificial intelligence applications.

It was a sign of how fast the world’s two largest economies had become engaged in a clash over technological advantage, with the United States trying to establish a stranglehold on advanced computing and semiconductor technology that China views as essential to its own ambitions.",,,,,,,,,british official stress threat china even amid russian aggression head britain gchq spy agency warned west

LONDON — Edwin Vermulst, a trade lawyer in Brussels, did not think twice before he agreed to write an article for Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, that would criticize a Belgian policy that threatened to box the company out of lucrative contracts. He had worked with the company for years.

After the article was published Dec. 17 on a Dutch-language website, he moved on to other work. “That was the beginning and end of my involvement,” he said.

Little did he know that the article would take on a life of its own. It soon became part of a covert pro-Huawei influence campaign in Belgium about 5G networks, the high-speed wireless technology at the center of a geopolitical dispute between the United States and China.

First, at least 14 Twitter accounts posing as telecommunications experts, writers and academics shared articles by Mr. Vermulst and many others attacking draft Belgium legislation that would limit “high risk” vendors like Huawei from building the country’s 5G system, according to Graphika, a research firm that studies misinformation and fake social media accounts. The pro-Huawei accounts used computer-generated profile pictures, a telltale sign of inauthentic activity.

Next, Huawei officials retweeted the fake accounts, giving the articles even wider reach to policymakers, journalists and business leaders. Kevin Liu, Huawei’s president for public affairs and communications in Western Europe, who has a verified Twitter account with 1.1 million followers, shared 60 posts from the fake accounts over three weeks in December, according to Graphika. Huawei’s official account in Europe, with more than five million followers, did so 47 times.

The effort suggests a new twist in social media manipulation, said Ben Nimmo, a Graphika investigator who helped identify the pro-Huawei campaign. Tactics once used mainly for government objectives — like Russia’s interference in the 2016 American presidential election — are being adapted to achieve corporate goals.

“It’s business rather than politics,” Mr. Nimmo said. “It’s not one country targeting another country. It looks like an operation to promote a major multinational’s interests — and to do it against a European state.”

Graphika, which provided research for the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation of Russian disinformation, said there was not enough evidence to identify who was behind the pro-Huawei operation.

Huawei said in a statement that it had started an internal investigation “to try to find out what exactly has happened and if there has been any inappropriate behavior.”

“Huawei has clear social media policies based on international best practice, and we take any suggestion that they have not been followed very seriously,” the company said. “Some social media and online activity has been brought to our attention suggesting we may have fallen short of these policies and of our wider Huawei values of openness, honesty and transparency.”

Twitter said it had removed the fake accounts after Graphika alerted it to the campaign on Dec. 30.

“Platform manipulation is strictly prohibited under the Twitter rules,” the company said in a statement. “If and when we have clear evidence, we will take action on accounts associated with this practice, which may include permanent suspension.”

Huawei, the crown jewel of China’s technology industry, has suffered from a sustained American campaign to keep its equipment from being used in new 5G networks around the world. The Trump administration said the company posed a national security threat, arguing that the Chinese government could use Huawei’s communications technology for spying. Huawei has strenuously denied those accusations.

The Trump administration took several steps to hobble Huawei, including an effort to cut off its supply of critical semiconductors — policies that the Biden administration hasn’t committed itself to retaining. Britain announced a ban of Huawei products last year; Germany and other European countries are debating restrictions of their own.

The 5G contracts are expected to be worth billions of dollars.

Belgium, home to the headquarters of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, illustrates the risk Huawei faces across Europe, the company’s biggest market outside China. Until now, Huawei and the Chinese company ZTE had dominated Belgium’s telecommunications-equipment market, according to Strand Consult, a research firm. But as the Belgian government considers new restrictions, wireless operators in the country are shifting 5G deals to rival companies.

“They fear this could spread to other parts of the world,” said John Strand, the founder of Strand Consult, which works with many wireless companies.

Mr. Nimmo said the pro-Huawei effort in Belgium had been clumsily executed and easy to identify. But it shows, he said, how underhanded internet campaigns try to launder seemingly legitimate material like Mr. Vermulst’s article through a mesh of websites and fake social media accounts to give it an air of impartiality and authenticity.

Graphika discovered the pro-Huawei effort after spotting suspicious posts about Belgium’s 5G policy from Twitter accounts used in an earlier pro-China operation. The Belgian magazine Knack and Michiel van Hulten, director of Transparency International in Brussels, also identified suspicious efforts to spread pro-Huawei information.

The 14 fake accounts amplified by Huawei officials spread positive articles about the company and negative views of Belgium’s 5G policy. The three-week campaign appeared to be tied to a Dec. 30 deadline in Belgium to review the country’s 5G policy.

To the casual Twitter user, the fake accounts looked legitimate. They included bland profile pictures along with career information. Many had more than 1,000 followers.

But on closer inspection, investigators identified problems with the accounts. Many of their followers appeared to be bots. And the pictures had the hallmarks of being created by artificial intelligence software, with perfectly centered photos but small imperfections, like asymmetrical glasses. Online businesses sell these kinds of photos of fake people, which can avoid the risk of detection that using pictures of real individuals can bring.

The fake accounts shared articles and commentary from different online publications, including EU Reporter, which publishes government news to its own website and affiliates like London Globe and New York Globe.

“If the Belgium government excludes specific suppliers, who will pay for it?” read the headline of one news story published on different EU Reporter websites.

Colin Stevens, the publisher of EU Reporter, said in an email that he had “no knowledge of any fake Twitter accounts promoting our articles.” Mr. Stevens said that Huawei had paid EU Reporter to publish opinion articles in the past, but that those were always labeled with disclaimers. The Belgian 5G stories were independently assigned without Huawei involvement, he said.

“EU Reporter would never knowingly be part of a disinformation campaign,” Mr. Stevens said.

In a few instances, investigators found articles like Mr. Vermulst’s, which Huawei paid for and included disclaimers about the financial arrangement. Other articles critical of the 5G policy appeared on websites that accept user-generated content without review, alongside author pictures that were the same as the computer-generated images in the fake Twitter profiles.

Phil Howard, the director of the Oxford Internet Institute, said operations like this would become more common as disinformation became increasingly commercialized. In a recent report, Oxford University researchers identified 63 instances in which public relations firms were involved in online disinformation operations in 2020. The work is typically on behalf of political figures or governments, he said, but can be applied to businesses.

“The flow of money is increasingly there,” Mr. Howard said. “Large-scale social media influence operations are now part of the communications tool kit for any large global corporation.”",,,,,,,,,nside

SHENZHEN, China, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The surprise launch of the latest high-end smartphone from Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies (HWT.UL) has triggered an international guessing game over what is inside it.
The company, which has been heavily targeted by U.S. government restrictions, began selling its latest Mate 60 Pro for 6,999 yuan ($964) online on Tuesday, raising eyebrows over its decision not to do any prior advertising and prompting widespread speculation over whether it could be 5G capable.

Following is what we know and don't know about the phone, and why it matters.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
From 2019, the U.S. cut Huawei's access to chipmaking tools essential for producing the most advanced handset models, with the company only able to sell limited batches of 5G models using stockpiled chips.
The U.S. and some European countries have called Huawei a security risk, which the company denies.
The restrictions devastated the business of a company that once competed with Apple and Samsung to be the world's biggest handset maker, with its consumer business peaking at 483 billion yuan in 2020 before plunging almost by half a year later.

But Huawei has repeatedly said it is fighting back and research firms told Reuters in July they believed it was plotting a return to the 5G smartphone industry by the end of this year, using its own advances in semiconductor design tools along with chipmaking from China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co (SMIC) (0981.HK), opens new tab.
If Huawei and China were capable of producing their own 5G chips, it would mark a significant advancement in their capabilities and a blow to U.S. efforts to limit its progress.

IS THE MATE PRO 60 A 5G PHONE?
Huawei has kept mum, only saying that the smartphone is the ""most powerful Mate model ever"".
Buyers of the phone have been posting tear-down videos and sharing speed tests on social media that suggest the Mate 60 Pro is capable of download speeds exceeding those of top line 5G phones, suggesting it is in a similar playing field.
The phone contains a new Kirin 9000s processor from Huawei's HiSilicon chip division, which appears to use advanced technology from SMIC, according to Dan Hutcheson, an analyst with TechInsights.

If it uses 7+nm or 5nm processes, production would likely be a very expensive process, Hutcheson said.
WHAT HAS BEEN THE REACTION?
The release sent Chinese social media users and state media into a frenzy, while tear-down firms around the world have raced to get their hands on the phone to see what is inside.
An initial batch of the phone quickly sold out online. Huawei's flagship store in the city of Shenzhen and its website say new stocks will only arrive at the earliest by mid-September.

Will London and Brussels go separate ways in their China policies after Brexit? Signs have been emerging since the UK began closely following US' footsteps. By contrast, certain EU members are maintaining cooperative attitudes toward Huawei as well as China. 

The argument that the UK's post-Brexit China policy will completely veer off that of the EU is bit exaggerated. Yet there will surely be differences. 

UK's foreign policy was once constrained by the EU, but Britain also got support from the bloc so that it could maintain a degree of strategic independence from the US. 

However, once London officially divorces from Brussels, it will lose the backup strength. In this context, especially when the US is changing its China strategy while increasing pressure on its allies over related issues, the UK will inevitably get close to the US. 

But Brussels will not take Washington's side in a clear-cut way. In the end, EU members will prioritize their own national interests.

Be issues regarding the Iranian nuclear deal, Paris Agreement on climate change, the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, Huawei's 5G technology, or US-Europe trade war, Washington has seldom taken into account the interests of its allies. 

The ""alliance"" is a concept which is used when they jointly face the outside world. Taking a look at the inside on the alliance, disputes over different national interests are easy to spot. 

Take Huawei's 5G. Washington showed little tolerance toward its European allies over their collaboration with Huawei. Yet it has never provided an alternative. 

What's Uncle Sam's plan? Making Europe suffer the losses along with the US? There is no way the EU won't be anxious in the current predicament - especially in an era of rapid development of digital technologies. US pressure is hurting Europe's interests. 

So the US tactic is trying to divide the continent and win over more of Europe's support, one country at a time. During US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's latest trip to the UK, he visited anti-China, pro-US lawmakers from the Conservative Party on Tuesday before meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson. What an obvious move to exert pressure on the UK's government. 

However, when most Western mainstream media outlets were busy covering how Pompeo was forging a coalition in Europe against China, they failed to intentionally or unintentionally touch upon the agreement reached on Monday between Brussels and Beijing regarding geographical indications (GIs), which is an agreement to protect products' intellectual property rights from the two sides. 

Although it was rarely mentioned in media coverage, the European Council called it ""the first significant bilateral trade agreement signed between the EU and China."" 

This is only part of the negotiations on investment and trade between the two sides this year. It proves that EU's China stance and China policy is pragmatic and that the big trend of cooperation between them won't be swayed. 

The EU is not seeking US-style hegemony, but is promoting its integration and strategic independence. Washington is obviously not satisfied with the aim since a stronger EU would pose challenges to the US. This is the reason why, since the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88), the US has been attempting to jeopardize the European integration. China, on the contrary, has been firmly supporting the process of the EU's integration. 

After all, the basic condition for the survival and prosperity of countries today is economy. The US manufacturing industry is waning. But China has the world's largest consumer market and labor market, it also has the most mature and comprehensive assortment of industrial sectors. 

The comparative advantage of cooperation with China is simply too obvious for Europe, which is yearning to revitalize its economy in the post-pandemic era. The irreplaceability of the Chinese market cannot be ignored. Would the EU fail to see that?

This is also the elephant in the room for British policymakers. The UK ignored the sacrifice in its own national interests when dealing with China-related issues lately. This is just like what happened during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, in which the UK kept in step with the US regardless of whether US' moves were approved by the UN. Listening to whatever Uncle Sam has to say has become the political correctness of the UK.

Nevertheless, it is believed the UK will eventually go back to the normal, rational path of its China policy. Take the Huawei issue. The country has actually left itself some leeway. London said it will remove Huawei from UK's 5G networks by 2027. At that time, the person in the Oval Office will have long been changed.

UK media outlet the Sunday Times recently published an edited extract from a book written by British investigative journalist Richard Kerbaj, which revealed how the US essentially forced Britain to block Chinese tech giant Huawei from the latter's 5G network development. According to Kerbaj, the UK was originally determined to engage with Huawei in its 5G network. However, after the US exerted great pressure on London and stepped up sanctions against Huawei, the UK government, under outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson, eventually banned Huawei from operating in the country.

Needless to say, this is profoundly embarrassing for the UK, which, following its divorce from the EU, has been seeking to bolster its global profile under the so-called Global Britain vision. This story, which comes with little surprise, makes the country look more like a US puppet, instead of a ""Global Britain."" 

Essentially, the fact that Britain had to change its own decision and sacrifice economic interest over the 5G development just because US thought otherwise is indicative of how Britain gradually lost its economic independence to ideological bias. When Britain starts to cut off cooperation with Chinese companies in accordance to US strategic requirements and arrangements, it does nothing but harms to its own interests and everyone knows that Washington will never compensate its loss. The case with 5G is a typical example of this. Britain followed the US ideological lead to ban Huawei, but it ended up spending more money and delaying the country's 5G rollout.

Indeed, the UK itself is to blame for its stagnant post-Brexit economy. The political atmosphere and orientation is very abnormal in the UK. Some British politicians like to take every opportunity to play up the so-called ""China threat"" theory, while UK prime minister candidates are competing on their toughness on China, instead of solutions to the country's considerable social and economic problems. The UK government has also frequently stepped in to prevent Chinese companies from investing in struggling British businesses purely out of political bias.

Yet, British politicians' insistence on drawing ideological lines against China, the largest trading partner with more than 120 countries and the world's factory, goes against their country's basic needs and the interests of the British people. 

Britain needs to be reminded that its Global Britain strategy looks increasingly like a ""closer with the US"" strategy. But the closer they get to the US, the worse their economy fares.

And the UK economy is indeed faltering. The Bank of England has warned the UK is sliding toward a recession and will keep shrinking until the end of 2023. Consumer price index in the UK rose to 40-year high of 10.1 percent in July. Workers at the UK's largest container port began an eight-day strike this week, the latest action by workers in an array of industries calling for higher pay amid soaring inflation.

Whether they like it or not, British politicians need to recognize that win-win cooperation with China can actually help Britain alleviate many of its economic problems, while ""decoupling"" from China would make its economy even more vulnerable.

At present, the US is on the verge of falling into a recession, while Europe is facing record high inflation. By comparison, China has been able to manage a relatively steady economic growth with its resilient manufacturing sector, despite all the headwinds from home and abroad. 

Maybe it is time for British politicians to think rationally about what kind of China policy is best for the UK, instead of shamelessly and irresponsibly sacrificing UK's economic interests to just please Washington.

This is also true for many US allies, particularly those in Europe. Given the energy and economic crisis facing European economies, it is paramount for countries to protect their domestic economies from the US' political agenda, which only ends up leaving European countries taking the hit, while the US gains, as shown in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.",,,,,,,,,gt voice forced huawei ban show global britain become u puppet global time published aug pm illustration liu ruigt illustration liu ruigt uk medium outlet sunday time recently published edited extract book written british investigative journalist richard kerbaj revealed u essentially forced britain block chinese tech giant huawei latter g network development according kerbaj uk originally determined engage huawei g network however u exerted great pressure london stepped sanction huawei uk government outgoing prime minister boris johnson eventually banned huawei operating country needle say profoundly embarrassing uk following divorce eu seeking bolster global profile socalled global britain vision story come little surprise make country look like u puppet instead global britain essentially fact britain change decision sacrifice economic interest g development u thought otherwise indicative britain gradually lost economic independence ideological bias britain start cut cooperation chinese company accordance u strategic requirement arrangement nothing harm interest everyone know washington never compensate loss case g typical example britain followed u ideological lead ban huawei ended spending money delaying country g rollout indeed uk blame stagnant postbrexit economy political atmosphere orientation abnormal uk british politician like take every opportunity play socalled china threat theory uk prime minister candidate competing toughness china instead solution country considerable social economic problem uk government also frequently stepped prevent chinese company investing struggling british business purely political bias yet british politician insistence drawing ideological line china largest trading partner country world factory go country basic need interest british people britain need reminded global britain strategy look increasingly like closer u strategy closer get u worse economy fare uk economy indeed faltering bank england warned uk sliding toward recession keep shrinking end consumer price index uk rose year high percent july worker uk largest container port began eightday strike week latest action worker array industry calling higher pay amid soaring inflation whether like british politician need recognize winwin cooperation china actually help britain alleviate many economic problem decoupling china would make economy even vulnerable present u verge falling recession europe facing record high inflation comparison china able manage relatively steady economic growth resilient manufacturing sector despite headwind home abroad maybe time british politician think rationally kind china policy best uk instead shamelessly irresponsibly sacrificing uk economic interest please washington also true many u ally particularly europe given energy economic crisis facing european economy paramount country protect domestic economy u political agenda end leaving european country taking hit u gain shown russiaukraine conflict

Recent studies found that the UK now has the least effective 5G rollout in the G7 group of advanced economies, and London lags behind rest of Europe when it comes to 5G network quality. This comes despite the government having made an electoral manifesto pledge to make gigabit broadband available to 85 percent of the UK by 2025 and nationwide by 2030. It further pledged £5 billion to achieve these results. 

However, by the end of 2020, the government U-turned on its policy due to pressure from the US to dump Huawei from its 5G networks as part of pushing an anti-China agenda on dubious security concerns. 

A report from The Times last year describes the Trump administration's deputy national security advisor, Matthew Pottinger, one of the architects of the anti-China agenda, as ""having yelled at the British cabinet for five hours"" to demand they change course on the Chinese telecommunications company. Despite not being in line with the government's pledge, going against national interests, and a security review having found no risks in Huawei's participation, the British government ultimately caved in and made a decision which has since been proved as counterproductive, expensive and ""cutting one's nose off to spite their face.""

It's no surprise that the UK is falling behind in the 5G race, not just in G7 but also worldwide. As a study by OpenSignal shows, the UK ranks an abysmal 39th out of 56 countries (both developing and developed) on 5G rollout and is well and truly in the ""slow lane."" The Financial Times citing Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, as saying in May that 5G mobile coverage from at least one operator was available at 82 percent of places where people live and work in the UK, but the figure falls to 22 percent for areas covered by all network providers.  

On a personal level, internet speeds are slow and home broadband operators are often prone to receiving service outages and extreme levels of disruption. Even just a few weeks ago our home internet was down for days because the infrastructure in the local area had been damaged. 

In contrast, despite being a much larger country, and not long ago far behind in economic development compared with Britain, China has established the largest and most comprehensive 5G rollout in the world. In China, not only is internet connectivity readily available, but it is also fast and reliable. In fact, China's whole manner of digitalisation and digital economy is far more advanced than that of Britain. This makes visiting Britain feel like you are going back in time. The facilitation of widespread electronic and digital infrastructure has been a masterclass of China's own economic development, which enables everything from a QR code culture to widespread online shopping opportunities and communications.

In having removed Huawei, the UK's 5G rollout has been setback years at an estimated cost of £18.2 billion to GDP. The decision has also come at an additional £2 billion to network providers to replace the equipment by the deadline of 2027. The subsequent delay to 5G rollout this decision caused, combined with the narrowing of the market which has driven up prices, now mean that an additional £34 billion is required in order to truly meet the demand for it by new technologies and industries. The UK government, however, is not willing to invest that much as the British economy is struggling across the board.

Meanwhile, countries who did not make this decision are powering ahead in 5G technology. For example, as quoted by Mobile Magazine, Spanish telecommunications company Telefónica, who went with Huawei, ""stated that 90% of the country's population will have access to 5G by 2022. The organization already provides 5G services to 80% of Spain's population, available in 1,300 towns and cities across the country."" In addition, some developing countries outside of Europe are now even able to move beyond 5G thanks to Huawei's role, such as the Philippines, a country which is far poorer than the UK and with a much larger population. 

All of this has seen the UK government ultimately fail on its pledge to ""level up"" the UK through broadband and internet connectivity, with rural areas being left behind and urban areas also in the slow lane. Instead of making Britain more economically competitive and ""global,"" they have U-turned, underwhelmed and subsequently undermined Britain's technological development through succumbing to foreign pressure. Rather than high-tech connectivity, the situation is once again a case of ""will the last one to leave Britain please turn out the lights?""",,,,,,,,,britain reaps whirlwind dumping huawei james smith published feb pm illustration liu ruigt illustration liu ruigt recent study found uk least effective g rollout g group advanced economy london lag behind rest europe come g network quality come despite government made electoral manifesto pledge make gigabit broadband available percent uk nationwide pledged billion achieve result however end government uturned policy due pressure u dump huawei g network part pushing antichina agenda dubious security concern report time last year describes trump administration deputy national security advisor matthew pottinger one architect antichina agenda yelled british cabinet five hour demand change course chinese telecommunication company despite line government pledge going national interest security review found risk huaweis participation british government ultimately caved made decision since proved counterproductive expensive cutting one nose spite face surprise uk falling behind g race g also worldwide study opensignal show uk rank abysmal th country developing developed g rollout well truly slow lane financial time citing ofcom telecom regulator saying may g mobile coverage least one operator available percent place people live work uk figure fall percent area covered network provider personal level internet speed slow home broadband operator often prone receiving service outage extreme level disruption even week ago home internet day infrastructure local area damaged contrast despite much larger country long ago far behind economic development compared britain china established largest comprehensive g rollout world china internet connectivity readily available also fast reliable fact china whole manner digitalisation digital economy far advanced britain make visiting britain feel like going back time facilitation widespread electronic digital infrastructure masterclass china economic development enables everything qr code culture widespread online shopping opportunity communication removed huawei uk g rollout setback year estimated cost billion gdp decision also come additional billion network provider replace equipment deadline subsequent delay g rollout decision caused combined narrowing market driven price mean additional billion required order truly meet demand new technology industry uk government however willing invest much british economy struggling across board meanwhile country make decision powering ahead g technology example quoted mobile magazine spanish telecommunication company telefónica went huawei stated country population access g organization already provides g service spain population available town city across country addition developing country outside europe even able move beyond g thanks huaweis role philippine country far poorer uk much larger population seen uk government ultimately fail pledge level uk broadband internet connectivity rural area left behind urban area also slow lane instead making britain economically competitive global uturned underwhelmed subsequently undermined britain technological development succumbing foreign pressure rather hightech connectivity situation case last one leave britain please turn light

UK diplomacy stands at a crossroads amid US FTA talks

Chlorine-washed chicken has become a controversial issue in talks over a potential free trade agreement between the UK and the US, which has been seen by some observers as a gauge of whether the UK can maintain its economic independence in the post-Brexit future.

Some of the country's biggest grocers including Aldi have openly refused to sell chlorinated chicken imported from the US. Such a development may underline growing concerns shared by British consumer groups, farmers' unions, and residents over a post-Brexit future where government could lower its food standards and other regulatory standards to win a trade deal with the US. The US has seemingly put great emphasis on its agricultural exports to the UK in free trade deal negotiations.

While British officials reiterated that the government would not compromise on the UK's high environmental protection, animal welfare and food safety standards in trade talks with the US, there are still signs that promise could be ditched under US lobbying pressure.

The US' growing influence over the UK is not limited to trade talks. The US has also played an important role in a series of disputes that have contributed to recent China-UK tensions. The Johnson government is expected to draw up plans to phase Huawei out of the UK's 5G network, representing a rollback of its previous decision to allow Huawei involvement.

The UK has long been a sophisticated player in the global political arena, but that may now change alongside the unprecedented impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the world. The UK also needs to deal with its own post-Brexit issues and pull through the economic and trade transition period. This critical and fragile moment has raised the question of whether the UK government will be able to withstand external pressure, especially from the US, to maintain its political and economic independence.

The stakes are high. Resisting external pressure and preserving economic independence would be in line with the UK's long-term economic interests, and would allow the country to safeguard its post-Brexit position in the global financial market.

But if it yields to the pressure and loses its independence, it would inevitably leave the world with the impression that the UK leans toward the Americans in the US-China confrontation. That would leave a scar on China-UK relations, which would be regretful as their bilateral ties experienced a golden age years ago. Such a scenario would also put the business communities at a loss.",,,,,,,,,source gt voice uk diplomacy stand crossroad amid u fta talk global time published jul pm photo xinhua chlorinewashed chicken become controversial issue talk potential free trade agreement uk u seen observer gauge whether uk maintain economic independence postbrexit future country biggest grocer including aldi openly refused sell chlorinated chicken imported u development may underline growing concern shared british consumer group farmer union resident postbrexit future government could lower food standard regulatory standard win trade deal u u seemingly put great emphasis agricultural export uk free trade deal negotiation british official reiterated government would compromise uk high environmental protection animal welfare food safety standard trade talk u still sign promise could ditched u lobbying pressure u growing influence uk limited trade talk u also played important role series dispute contributed recent chinauk tension johnson government expected draw plan phase huawei uk g network representing rollback previous decision allow huawei involvement uk long sophisticated player global political arena may change alongside unprecedented impact coronavirus pandemic world uk also need deal postbrexit issue pull economic trade transition period critical fragile moment raised question whether uk government able withstand external pressure especially u maintain political economic independence stake high resisting external pressure preserving economic independence would line uk longterm economic interest would allow country safeguard postbrexit position global financial market yield pressure loses independence would inevitably leave world impression uk lean toward american uschina confrontation would leave scar chinauk relation would regretful bilateral tie experienced golden age year ago scenario would also put business community loss

UK economy can’t afford rejection of Chinese firms over HK

Having originally said it would give Huawei a ""limited role"" in the construction of its 5G network, the UK is now looking to phase the Chinese telecoms giant out of its plans entirely, giving rise to concerns that will it choose to turn against more Chinese companies for unknown political reasons.

In the UK government's internal discussions on China-related topics, Hong Kong is almost definitely a key issue. Considering the timing of the UK's attitude reversal on Huawei, its negative view of China's national security legislation for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) was likely an important deciding factor.

However, the UK couldn't cite Hong Kong as a reason to ban the Chinese tech giant from its 5G network, so the Johnson government had to instead reference the US' groundless security accusation. 

If the UK had cited the Hong Kong issue as an excuse to ban Huawei, it would have put the UK in an awkward position and given the international community the impression that it wantonly uses market tools to pursue political aims. It would have been extremely harmful for the UK's business environment.

Regarding Huawei, the UK has been trying to hold off pressure from the US through technical means, but the Hong Kong issue has caused the country's position on China - and Huawei - to fundamentally change.

The UK is not expected to expand its Huawei shift to a wider range of Chinese companies and investments as it will be unable to find more excuses to restrict Chinese players, regardless of its complex sentiment due to the Hong Kong issue.

Such a move is particularly unlikely as the UK is currently facing the dual threat of significant Brexit uncertainty and the COVID-19 pandemic. Its economy has suffered its worst quarterly recession since 1979 due to shocks from the pandemic, with its GDP dropping 2.2 percent in the first three months of the year. The country has less than six months left before its transitional UK-EU trade agreement expires, and a new trade deal with the EU remains in the making. 

Against this backdrop, the UK's top priorities are maintaining an appealing investment environment and continuing to attract foreign investment. The UK economy can ill afford British indulgence in a colonial-era fantasy, yet it has arrogantly rejected Chinese investments that are badly needed.

If Chinese companies continue to be optimistic about the prospects of the UK market, they will continue their investment plans. Although China-UK relations are now experiencing setbacks, the UK will not become a chasm to avoid.

But Chinese companies should be wary that the UK will continue strengthening its scrutiny of Chinese investments and may even set implicit barriers. Under this trend, the UK may introduce more rules. The duration of investment reviews may be extended, and some industries in strategic areas may set investment ceilings.",,,,,,,,,comment expert assessment uk economy cant afford rejection chinese firm hk cui hongjian published jul pm illustration tang tengfeigt originally said would give huawei limited role construction g network uk looking phase chinese telecom giant plan entirely giving rise concern choose turn chinese company unknown political reason uk government internal discussion chinarelated topic hong kong almost definitely key issue considering timing uk attitude reversal huawei negative view china national security legislation hong kong special administrative region hksar likely important deciding factor however uk couldnt cite hong kong reason ban chinese tech giant g network johnson government instead reference u groundless security accusation uk cited hong kong issue excuse ban huawei would put uk awkward position given international community impression wantonly us market tool pursue political aim would extremely harmful uk business environment regarding huawei uk trying hold pressure u technical mean hong kong issue caused country position china huawei fundamentally change uk expected expand huawei shift wider range chinese company investment unable find excuse restrict chinese player regardless complex sentiment due hong kong issue move particularly unlikely uk currently facing dual threat significant brexit uncertainty covid pandemic economy suffered worst quarterly recession since due shock pandemic gdp dropping percent first three month year country le six month left transitional ukeu trade agreement expires new trade deal eu remains making backdrop uk top priority maintaining appealing investment environment continuing attract foreign investment uk economy ill afford british indulgence colonialera fantasy yet arrogantly rejected chinese investment badly needed chinese company continue optimistic prospect uk market continue investment plan although chinauk relation experiencing setback uk become chasm avoid chinese company wary uk continue strengthening scrutiny chinese investment may even set implicit barrier trend uk may introduce rule duration investment review may extended industry strategic area may set investment ceiling

Huawei a target for US, UK after National Security Law for HK is enacted
US, UK target Huawei in response to legislation

Technology company Huawei has become a target for a few of Western countries to vent their ""anger"" at China, on heels of the enactment of the National Security Law for Hong Kong by the country's top legislature on Tuesday.

But the restrictions put on Huawei by the US and UK governments amount to ""bluffing rather than biting"", Chinese industry insiders said.

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Tuesday (US time) officially designated Huawei and ZTE as US' national security threats. Under this classification, US telecom operators are not allowed to use an $8.3 billion government subsidy program, known as the Universal Service Fund, to purchase, maintain or support any equipment or services provided by the two Chinese telecom giants.

In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press briefing on Wednesday that banning US carriers from purchasing Huawei and ZTE products will not improve US cybersecurity, but it will have a serious impact on network services in its rural areas. 

Zhao urged the US side to stop generalizing the concept of national security and provide a fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson toughened rhetoric on Huawei on Tuesday too. He said he would protect British critical infrastructure from ""hostile state vendors"" as he expressed concern over a new security legislation for Hong Kong, according to media reports.

Neither Huawei nor ZTE had responded to interview requests by the Global Times as of press time.

 ""It is obvious that Huawei is caught in the crossfire between China and a couple of Western nations over the security law for Hong Kong,"" said Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst and close follower of Huawei, on Wednesday. 

Ma said that a cluster of Western politicians always target Huawei because the company, as a global leader of telecom technology innovations, is often in the media spotlight. The politicians want to sling mud at Huawei and castigate the Chinese company, because they are ""not happy"" with the new security law enacted for Hong Kong.

More importantly, making Huawei a target seems ""opportune"" for the Western countries and doesn't cost them much, the analyst said.

""On the one hand, the Trump administration dares not make the Phase One trade deal to bargaining chips with Beijing. On the other hand, Chinese policymakers and Huawei itself have anticipated such a result from Washington,"" Ma explained. 

Chinese observers said that the curbs on Huawei will not inflict much damage on its businesses, as the US has run out of cards to harm Huawei. 

In terms of the UK side, analysts said the British government may just ""say one thing but do another"", as the Johnson administration prioritizes economic interests over playing political power games. 

In late June, just days before the passage of the National Security Law for Hong Kong by China's NPC Standing Committee - a result that markets widely anticipated - the UK government approved Huawei's plan to build a 1 billion pound ($1.24 billion) chip research and manufacturing facility in England.",,,,,,,,,source economy huawei target u uk national security law hk enacted u uk target huawei response legislation gt staff reporter published jul pm woman listens debate huawei cyber security transparency center brussels belgium jan xinhuazhang cheng technology company huawei become target western country vent anger china heel enactment national security law hong kong country top legislature tuesday restriction put huawei u uk government amount bluffing rather biting chinese industry insider said u federal communication commission fcc tuesday u time officially designated huawei zte u national security threat classification u telecom operator allowed use billion government subsidy program known universal service fund purchase maintain support equipment service provided two chinese telecom giant response chinese foreign ministry spokesperson zhao lijian said press briefing wednesday banning u carrier purchasing huawei zte product improve u cybersecurity serious impact network service rural area zhao urged u side stop generalizing concept national security provide fair nondiscriminatory environment chinese company uk prime minister boris johnson toughened rhetoric huawei tuesday said would protect british critical infrastructure hostile state vendor expressed concern new security legislation hong kong according medium report neither huawei zte responded interview request global time press time obvious huawei caught crossfire china couple western nation security law hong kong said jihua veteran industry analyst close follower huawei wednesday said cluster western politician always target huawei company global leader telecom technology innovation often medium spotlight politician want sling mud huawei castigate chinese company happy new security law enacted hong kong importantly making huawei target seems opportune western country doesnt cost much analyst said one hand trump administration dare make phase one trade deal bargaining chip beijing hand chinese policymakers huawei anticipated result washington explained chinese observer said curb huawei inflict much damage business u run card harm huawei term uk side analyst said british government may say one thing another johnson administration prioritizes economic interest playing political power game late june day passage national security law hong kong china npc standing committee result market widely anticipated uk government approved huaweis plan build billion pound billion chip research manufacturing facility england

The connections may not immediately seem evident between COVID-19, Brexit, and the new intensified drive by the US to try to force Britain to cut Huawei out of its 5G network. But they immediately become clear when the present economic, and therefore geopolitical, consequences of the US and UK governments' catastrophic errors in mishandling COVID-19 are understood.

Due to these government errors, COVID-19 struck Britain and the US in ways that created the world's greatest pandemic disasters - the UK is suffering the highest number of daily deaths per capita of any country, and the US has passed the milestone of 100,000 coronavirus deaths. The economic prospects in 2020 for both countries are therefore grim - the IMF projects the US' GDP will fall by 5.9 percent and the UK's by 6.5 percent. 

Relating these disasters to Huawei, earlier this year, before COVID-19, the UK government rejected US demands that Huawei should not participate in the UK's 5G network. The decision on this issue certainly made concessions to the US by ruling that Huawei could not play a role in ""core"" parts of the 5G network, and a 35 percent limit was placed on Huawei's total participation. This was a retreat from the earlier ""golden period"" of UK-China relations under Cameron, when Huawei head Ren Zhengfei was a guest at the prime minister's official residence. Nevertheless, the Johnson government's decision rejected US demands that Huawei be entirely excluded from Britain's 5G network. 

Also, embarrassingly for future US pressure, the UK's official National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) affirmed that no security risk to Britain was created by the government's decision: ""The cap at 35 percent ensures the UK will not become nationally dependent.""

The UK government allowed Huawei to participate in the UK's 5G network simply because it was in the direct interests of the national economy. Facing significant downward economic pressure due to Brexit, the UK government declared that it would launch a policy of technological upgrading. For 5G, the UK set the ambitious target for the entire country to have access to ""gigabit capable"" network speeds by 2025 - which in practice relied on 5G. 

Setting a 35 percent limit on Huawei's participation in its 5G was already expensive for the UK and its telecoms operators. In January, BT, the former British Telecom, estimated the 35 percent limit would cost it around 500 million pounds ($613.35 million) over five years. A report from media and telecoms specialist Enders Analysis estimated a full 5G ban on Huawei would cost UK networks 1.5 billion pounds.

Furthermore, as even the strongly pro-Johnson and anti-China newspaper the Daily Telegraph noted: ""Huawei kit already makes up large parts of the UK's 4G mobile networks… '5G depends heavily on 4G infrastructure,' says Matthew Howett, of Assembly Research. 'Switching out Huawei for 5G will mean replacing some 4G equipment which would need to be added to that cost.' Assembly estimated the total economic cost would be 7 billion pounds.""

The loss from banning Huawei would also significantly slow 5G's introduction. Regarding the government's 2025 goal: ""A sudden u-turn [on Huawei] could push this target into the distance.""

But despite the considerable damage that would be done to the UK's economy by excluding Huawei, the Trump administration refused to accept the Johnson government's decision. Instead it set about creating strategic levers to increase pressure on the UK as part of a global offensive against Huawei.

Internationally, the US introduced sanctions attempting to force foreign manufacturers using US chipmaking equipment to obtain a US government license before being able to sell chips to Huawei. 

Within Britain, the US helped create a so-called ""China Research Group"" (CRG) of Conservative MPs. The name was significant as it was modeled on the ""European Research Group"" of Tory MPs which was the driving force behind Brexit. Indeed, the two groups substantially overlapped as Brexit's aim had always been more direct subordination of Britain to the US. 

The CRG's goal was made clear when it immediately launched a campaign to overturn the Johnson government's decision to allow Huawei to participate in Britain's 5G. It directly linked this to COVID-19, with the group's leader Tom Tugendhat claiming the coronavirus required an ""urgent need for a better understanding of China's place in the world.""

The CRG's tactical goal was clear. The Johnson government's majority in the House of Commons is 80. Therefore, if 40 Conservative MPs would vote against the government's policy and with the opposition Labour Party, which has a reactionary position on Huawei, then the government would be defeated on Huawei. By these means the US would not need to successfully persuade the Johnson government to reverse its decision on Huawei - the US could aim to ensure the government was outvoted in Parliament. All-out backing by the US would very probably give the CRG the ability to gain the votes of 40 Tory MPs.

Faced with the threat of Parliamentary defeat by the US, the Johnson government set about retreating from its previous Huawei decision. On May 23 a government spokesman announced: ""Following the US announcement of additional sanctions against Huawei, the NCSC is looking carefully at any impact they could have to the UK's networks."" The government simultaneously leaked to British newspapers that it would propose a so called ""compromise"" by which it would push for the total elimination of Huawei equipment in British phone networks by 2023. 

This latter decision would, naturally, be a further step toward accepting US requirements despite the damage that would be done to the British economy. The CRG and the US are creating maximum pressure for the UK to accept US demands before Johnson and Trump's likely meeting at the G-7 Summit next month. 

Johnson would undoubtedly like to maintain the original decision on Huawei, as making it came at the cost of a dispute with the US. But now, via the CRG, he can feel the US grip tightening around the UK government's throat. The threat to overturn the Johnson government's previous decision on Huawei is therefore not a negotiating bluff; it is a direct result of US pressure.

China's proposals for UK-China economic cooperation, including on 5G, are not only in its own interests but in the UK's national interests. But the Johnson government is experiencing the full consequences of its decision to support Brexit. Outside the EU its international goal is a trade treaty with the US. But while the EU is a powerful international bloc with the economic strength to resist the US, the UK outside the EU is much too weak to do so. Therefore, in negotiations on a trade treaty, the US can apply relentless pressure to impose its own conditions - it is proposing to the UK a similar clause to the new US trade treaty with Canada and Mexico, which gives the US veto rights over the UK signing trade agreements with China, and the US can increase pressure on the UK on Huawei.

The UK was already in a weak position to resist these attacks even before its government's mishandling of COVID-19 led to the health, and consequent economic, disaster already noted. Now, facing the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression, the UK is even more trapped in a strategy of Brexit which imposes subordination to the US. 

The Johnson government has cut itself from any participation in the EU's stimulus package to recover from COVID-19 and will therefore be forced to orient even more toward the US, even if this damages UK's economy.  From the viewpoint of UK's national interests, and its own declared strategy of a 'global Britain,' the Johnson government should give high priority to relations with China. But in practice, faced with the US offensive, the Johnson government is under intense pressure to act against UK's interests on Huawei.

The US will intensify that pressure on the UK due to the serious situation its own economy faces.  Following the international financial crisis, the US failure to rapidly overcome this, and China's success in comparison, led to a huge shift in the international relation of economic forces against the US - during 2007-19 China's economy grew by 150 percent while the US' grew by 22 percent. 

A further similar shift in the international relation of forces in favor of China during the COVID-19 crisis would therefore be catastrophic for the US. But a huge downturn in the US economy under COVID-19's impact is inevitable - the US possesses neither the ideology nor the practical economic mechanisms to prevent this. The only question during the COVID-19 crisis is therefore: By how much will China's economy outperform the US? 

As the US is incapable of stopping its own economic downturn, the only means it has to attempt to turn the relation of forces against China during COVID-19 is to try to slow China's economy - regardless of any severely negative effects for other countries which would benefit from cooperation with China. The attack on Huawei is part of that - and the US' renewed attack on the UK over Huawei is intensified by the US offensive to attempt to avoid the consequences of its catastrophic mishandling of COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,u intensifying attack uk huawei john ross published may pm g technology exhibition held hangzhou east china zhejiang province jan xinhuaxu yu connection may immediately seem evident
