Britain reaps the whirlwind for dumping Huawei - Global Times,"Published: Feb 29, 2024 06:23 PM",Global Times,By James Smith,Opinion,"Illustration: Liu Rui/GTRecent studies found that the UK now has the least effective 5G rollout in the G7 group of advanced economies, and London lags behind rest of Europe when it comes to 5G network quality. This comes despite the government having made an electoral manifesto pledge to make gigabit broadband available to 85 percent of the UK by 2025 and nationwide by 2030. It further pledged £5 billion to achieve these results.However, by the end of 2020, the government U-turned on its policy due to pressure from the US to dump Huawei from its 5G networks as part of pushing an anti-China agenda on dubious security concerns.A report from The Times last year describes the Trump administration's deputy national security advisor, Matthew Pottinger, one of the architects of the anti-China agenda, as ""having yelled at the British cabinet for five hours"" to demand they change course on the Chinese telecommunications company. Despite not being in line with the government's pledge, going against national interests, and a security review having found no risks in Huawei's participation, the British government ultimately caved in and made a decision which has since been proved as counterproductive, expensive and ""cutting one's nose off to spite their face.""It's no surprise that the UK is falling behind in the 5G race, not just in G7 but also worldwide. As a study by OpenSignal shows, the UK ranks an abysmal 39th out of 56 countries (both developing and developed) on 5G rollout and is well and truly in the ""slow lane."" The Financial Times citing Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, as saying in May that 5G mobile coverage from at least one operator was available at 82 percent of places where people live and work in the UK, but the figure falls to 22 percent for areas covered by all network providers.On a personal level, internet speeds are slow and home broadband operators are often prone to receiving service outages and extreme levels of disruption. Even just a few weeks ago our home internet was down for days because the infrastructure in the local area had been damaged.In contrast, despite being a much larger country, and not long ago far behind in economic development compared with Britain, China has established the largest and most comprehensive 5G rollout in the world. In China, not only is internet connectivity readily available, but it is also fast and reliable. In fact, China's whole manner of digitalisation and digital economy is far more advanced than that of Britain. This makes visiting Britain feel like you are going back in time. The facilitation of widespread electronic and digital infrastructure has been a masterclass of China's own economic development, which enables everything from a QR code culture to widespread online shopping opportunities and communications.In having removed Huawei, the UK's 5G rollout has been setback years at an estimated cost of £18.2 billion to GDP. The decision has also come at an additional £2 billion to network providers to replace the equipment by the deadline of 2027. The subsequent delay to 5G rollout this decision caused, combined with the narrowing of the market which has driven up prices, now mean that an additional £34 billion is required in order to truly meet the demand for it by new technologies and industries. The UK government, however, is not willing to invest that much as the British economy is struggling across the board.Meanwhile, countries who did not make this decision are powering ahead in 5G technology. For example, as quoted by Mobile Magazine, Spanish telecommunications company Telefónica, who went with Huawei, ""stated that 90% of the country's population will have access to 5G by 2022. The organization already provides 5G services to 80% of Spain's population, available in 1,300 towns and cities across the country."" In addition, some developing countries outside of Europe are now even able to move beyond 5G thanks to Huawei's role, such as the Philippines, a country which is far poorer than the UK and with a much larger population.All of this has seen the UK government ultimately fail on its pledge to ""level up"" the UK through broadband and internet connectivity, with rural areas being left behind and urban areas also in the slow lane. Instead of making Britain more economically competitive and ""global,"" they have U-turned, underwhelmed and subsequently undermined Britain's technological development through succumbing to foreign pressure. Rather than high-tech connectivity, the situation is once again a case of ""will the last one to leave Britain please turn out the lights?""The author is a political and historical relations analyst. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn"
London's Huawei decision 'turning point' for China-UK ties: analyst - Global Times,"Published: Jul 14, 2020 07:56 PM Updated: Jul 17, 2020 04:10 PM",Global Times,"By

Zhang Hongpei",News,"Photo: VCGThe UK's move to ban Huawei may further sour strained China-UK political ties, largely reduce personnel exchanges, and most likely prompt Beijing to take reciprocal measures against London's discriminatory policy, Chinese observers said.The UK's mobile providers are being banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after December 31, and they must also remove all of the Chinese firm's 5G kits from their networks by 2027, the UK said on Tuesday, according to a BBC report.New restrictions are also being applied to the use of the Chinese company's broadband kit. The UK government wants operators to ""transition away"" from purchasing new Huawei equipment for use in the full-fiber network, said BBC.The UK government's decision to ban Huawei has led it into a quagmire that the country - which just exited the EU - can't emerge from in the next few years, Chinese analysts said.""It will have very bad implications for the country. The UK will lag behind other major economies in utilizing the next-generation ultra-fast mobile technology, and potentially revolutionary new business models as well, to be enabled by Huawei's 5G,"" a Beijing-based industry analyst and a close follower of Huawei surnamed Li, told the Global Times on Tuesday.""China will certainly retaliate against UK's discriminatory policy, and UK's trade ties with China will be hurt,"" Li said.""China will closely watch the decision,"" Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a routine press conference on Tuesday. He noted that the move could be an ""indicator"" of whether it's safe for China to continue its investment in the UK. It could also serve as a touchstone of the market trend in the UK after the Brexit.The decision also shows whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies in the country, Zhao warned.The UK decided in January to let Huawei continue its role in the country's 5G network despite pressure from the US to crack down on the Chinese firm, but with restrictions. The company was excluded from providing ""core"" 5G gear.Huawei could have been a positive driver for cooperation between China and the UK, but with the change of course, the bilateral relationship could worsen further. China, for a long time, may divert its political focus from the UK to the vast European continent, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday.UK's change of course and its back-and-forth attitude toward Huawei over the past months is driven by multiple reasons - intensified US pressure and the eagerness to maintain its massive untold interests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under China's national security law for Hong Kong, Cui said.""Without Huawei as a 'buffer,' China could take a tougher stance and spare no feelings for the UK when dealing with the issues in the Hong Kong SAR,"" said Cui.Nevertheless, as the UK is no longer an EU member, the decision won't have a major influence on other countries in Europe, and it will also not affect Huawei's cooperation with Europe, which is a much bigger market than Britain, Cui noted.A Huawei store stands next to a Globe Telecom booth in Makati City, the Philippines on April 14, 2019. Photo: cnsphotoMajor blow to UK economyBy excluding Huawei, the UK, which is already caught between Brexit woes and an economic setback amid the COVID-19 pandemic, could face major consequences that it may not be able to bear - from industrial impacts potentially costing millions of dollars to the harm done to China-UK ties, analysts said.""Excluding Huawei's participation in the UK's next-generation networks means the country's telecommunications sector would suffer unbearable losses, and the extra costs would shift to consumers,"" said Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst.Huawei said the UK ban on its 5G involvement is disappointing, and the decision is a bad news for anyone in the UK with mobile phone. ""Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicized, this is about US trade policy and not security.""It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide. Instead of 'leveling up,' the government is leveling down and we urge them to reconsider, Huawei said.Andy Purdy, Chief Security Officer of Huawei, has urged the US government and the Chinese government to hold discussions about the Chinese tech giant, after the UK banned the company from its 5G network. “I think escalation in these situations is a huge mistake,” he said.Purdy told the Global Times that US officials would ""apparently not” be willing to hold talks with their Chinese counterparts. “Now it's a campaign issue on top of everything else,"" he said.Ma told the Global Times on Tuesday that such a tough stance against Huawei shows the UK government can sacrifice its own 5G development and local operators' business interests just for political reasons, by taking aim at a Chinese company that has nothing to do with politics.Analysts noted more UK firms are set to be sacrificed for the UK's political stance. For instance, HSBC, the London-headquartered multinational bank, has been the latest scapegoat - being blamed by UK politicians for its support for the national security law for Hong Kong, and faced with growing controversy over the legal battle with Huawei, the firm has been under tremendous pressure in recent days.With the UK's ban on Huawei, the London-based lender may now face a worsening dilemma, where it's already far from safety regarding reprisals, said insiders, noting that HSBC should be more concerned about its situation than Huawei.For Huawei, confidence in its 5G gear expansion in overseas markets would not be heavily influenced, according to Ma, which can be insinuated by the timing the unlisted Chinese firm released its semi-annual earnings one day prior to the announcement of the UK's decision.Huawei regularly released such reports at month's end.""The decision has also impacted upon the UK's independent diplomacy, as it bows more to US pressure to crack down on Huawei,"" Ma noted.Huawei posted revenue of 454 billion ($64.88 billion) in the first half of 2020, a 13.1 percent increase year-on-year, with a net profit margin of 9.2 percent, a hard-won feat that beat forecasts amid the pandemic and an intensified US crackdown campaign.Huawei's carriers, enterprises, and consumer businesses had revenue of 159.6 billion yuan, 36.3 billion yuan, and 255.8 billion yuan respectively, all recording slight growth compared to the same period last year.""Huawei has promised to continue fulfilling its obligations to customers and suppliers, and to survive, forge ahead, and contribute to the global digital economy and technological development, no matter what future challenges the company faces,"" the firm said."
China won’t passively watch UK’s Huawei ban: Global Times editorial  - Global Times,"Published: Jul 15, 2020 09:38 AM",Global Times,By Global Times,Opinion,"Photo: ICThe UK government announced that the UK's mobile providers are banned from buying Huawei 5G equipment from the end of this year. In addition, the government requires operators to remove all Huawei equipment from the UK's telecommunications network by 2027. At the beginning of this year, the Johnson administration approved some limited involvement of Huawei in constructing UK's 5G network, now it reversed course.This is certainly a blow to Huawei. UK's rejection of Huawei is likely to increase other countries' hesitation.However, the UK government has given a buffer period, allowing mobile providers to stop buying Huawei equipment by the end of this year and remove Huawei equipment by 2027, indicating that banning Huawei is a difficult action for it. UK telecoms operators widely oppose the decision of banning Huawei and UK government officials have publicly acknowledged that the latest decision will delay the launch of 5G networks by two to three years and cost 2 billion pounds more.UK's decision is obviously the result of heavy pressure from Washington. However, using Huawei or not is ultimately a matter of technology and economy. As long as Huawei can survive the US crackdown and maintain its technological lead, the decision of the UK will be only for now, and Huawei still has the chance for another comeback in the UK market.Huawei's European rivals cannot compete with Huawei. The West may support them with administrative means, however, it will not help them become stronger. So Huawei should not feel discouraged. Growing under pressure is the only choice of Huawei.The UK is an important member of the Five Eyes, which now follows Washington's policy loyally. The UK's decision means huge economic loss for it. It is highly doubtful that other European countries will make the same decision.Huawei's sales in the first half of this year increased by 13.1 percent year-on-year despite the epidemic. Some Western countries have been saying one thing on Huawei, but doing another. Even the US itself repeatedly approves certain contracts with Huawei. It's really not easy to say goodbye to Huawei.It's necessary for China to retaliate against UK, otherwise wouldn't we be too easy to bully? Such retaliation should be public and painful for the UK. But it's unnecessary to turn it into a China-UK confrontation. The UK is not the US, nor Australia, nor Canada. It is a relative ""weak link"" in the Five Eyes. In the long run, the UK has no reason to turn against China, with the Hong Kong issue fading out.China needs to speed up the development of its telecommunications technology. There will be many countries and many companies wavering under the pressure of the US. The most effective way for China to influence them will be to increase our strength and attractiveness, and nothing else."
Fate of Qing Dynasty offers some lessons for UK - Global Times,"Published: Jul 21, 2020 08:26 PM",Global Times,By Ai Jun,News,"Huawei File photo:VCGDoes the mind-set of today's Great Britain resemble that of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the last imperial dynasty of China?After the UK government announced a ban on Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network, British scholar Martin Jacques tweeted, ""History turns full circle. In 1793, Chinese Emperor Qianlong told the British King: 'We don't have the slightest need of your country's manufactures.' So marked the start of China's 150-year decline. In 2020, UK tells China that it has no need of China's latest technology.""The remarks were quoted by Chinese Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming during his interview with BBC on Sunday. Liu added, ""I do not know what will happen in the next 150 years.""What the UK faces now is somewhat similar to what the Qing Dynasty had faced. Any country with a splendid history might feel uncertain in the face of an emerging power.People who are familiar with the Qing Dynasty know the closed-door policy during the period well. When then British lord George Macartney led a mission in 1793 to visit Emperor Qianlong (1711-1799) of the Qing Dynasty and showed the latter a telescope, clocks and watches, models of artillery and warships, Qianlong described them as merely diabolical tricks and witchcraft. History soon witnessed how the dynasty declined due to its close-door policy.The most valuable lesson China has learned from that period is that a country must open up to advanced ideas, technologies and countries if it wishes to develop itself. Today's China is keeping its door wide open to the world, because it has suffered enough from remaining closed and self-fettered.Huawei has been operating in the UK for over 20 years, with its equipment and technologies being widely used in the country's 2G, 3G and 4G networks. Eliminating the company's role would thus be equivalent to ""self-harm"" of UK's telecoms networks, as some British observers believe.Assembly Research, a London-based independent analyst firm, issued a report in 2019, claiming ""a partial, or full restriction on the use of Huawei could result in a delay to the 5G roll-out of between 18 and 24 months."" Some observers even claimed it would take a decade to entirely remove Huawei from UK's network currently in use.Certain British politicians believe the UK will be fine without the Chinese company. Sure, it will be all right, but the country will have to waste a few years to make up for the price paid in this geopolitical game, when other parts of the world are accelerating their pace in developing high technology in telecoms network.When Emperor Qianlong cast a cold eye to advanced technologies, he made the decision himself. But when London decided to ban Huawei, coercion from Washington could be sensed.The UK had its glorious days. Thanks to its pioneering spirit in science and technology, it became the world's first industrialized country. The prosperity of the British Empire was also closely linked to trade. Regrettably, UK's current high-tech agenda is dominated by the US. Would London sober up and make decisions for its best interests on its own? It's important to draw wisdom from history.China has always been sincere to the UK. And it is hoped London can escape distractions when interacting with Beijing."
‘Great Britain’ cannot be ‘Great’ without independent policies toward China: Chinese envoy - Global Times,"Published: Aug 16, 2020 09:33 PM",Global Times,By Global Times,News,"A view of London Photo: ICEditor's Note:China-UK relations have been under growing strain recently due to UK's attitudes on issues such as Hong Kong, Huawei and Xinjiang. The situation has sparked concerns over whether the ""Golden Era"" between China and the UK has come to an end.In an exclusive interview with the Global Times (GT) on Friday, Liu Xiaoming, Chinese Ambassador to the UK, made remarks on topics such as UK's recent ban on Huawei's 5G network, its responses to Hong Kong-related issues and the future of China-UK ties.Ambassador Liu noted the UK now has ""understanding deficit"" and a ""trust deficit"" in its policies toward China. He called for promoting closer links instead of ""decoupling"" in order to promote trust, manage differences and remove the ""deficits.""GT: With regard to the UK's recent decisions to change the policy for British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) passport holders, ban Huawei from its 5G networks, and suspend the extradition treaty with Hong Kong indefinitely, what countermeasures will China take?Ambassador Liu: The UK Government, in disregard of China's solemn representations, is bent on carrying out political manipulation on the issues of BN(O) and the extradition treaty with Hong Kong. The Chinese side strongly opposes such acts of the UK side which openly go against its own pledge, violate international law and the basic norms governing international relations, and blatantly interfere in Hong Kong affairs, which are internal affairs of China. China will consider refusing to recognize BN(O) passports as valid travel documents and reserves the right to take further countermeasures.On the issue of Huawei, the UK Government has contravened its previous decision and banned 5G equipment of Huawei, claiming the company poses ""risks"" without any evidence. This went against the principles of market economy and rules of free trade, jeopardized China-UK mutual trust, undermined the confidence of Chinese businesses in making investments in the UK, and intoxicated the atmosphere for China-UK business cooperation. The Chinese side will evaluate this decision comprehensively and seriously and take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies.China-UK relationship has encountered serious setbacks due to the above-mentioned wrong remarks and deeds of the UK side. I have emphasized time and again that China is a partner of the UK, rather than a rival, still less an enemy; China's development creates opportunities for the UK, rather than challenges, still less threats. A steady and sound China-UK relationship is in the interests of both the two countries and beyond. I hope the UK side will return to an independent, reasonable and pragmatic China policy, and stop going down the wrong path. Otherwise, it will have to bear all the consequences.GT: On the issue of BN(O), will China revoke the Chinese nationality or the right of abode in Hong Kong of the Hong Kong residents who have accepted the unilateral arrangements of the UK Government?Ambassador Liu: It is made clear in the Explanations of Some Questions by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Concerning the Implementation of the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals, whether or not they are holders of the British National (Overseas) passport. In fact, as early as 1985 when the UK Government adopted the law to create the BN(O) status, it made the pledge that BN(O) passport holders who are Chinese citizens residing in Hong Kong shall not have the right of abode in the UK. Now the UK Government has gone back on its words and offered ""a route for BN(O) passport holders to apply for citizenship in the UK"". This decision is purely political manipulation, and its real intention is to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and disrupt the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong SAR. The Chinese side strongly opposes this. We will consider refusing to recognize BN(O) passports as valid travel documents and reserve the right to take further countermeasures.Hong Kong has been returned to China and is now a special administrative region of China. Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs and brook no external interference in any form. We have urged the UK side, time and again, to recognize the fact that Hong Kong is part of China, immediately right the wrongs, and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form. Such interference will be self-defeating.Liu Xiaoming, Chinese Ambassador to the UK Photos: Courtesy of the Chinese Embassay to the UKGT: With the UK suspending the extradition treaty with Hong Kong, what impact will it have on China, including Hong Kong? Will it affect the pursuit and arrest of fugitives? Will the Chinese side engage in further communications with the UK side through the diplomatic channel?Ambassador Liu: The unilateral suspension of the extradition treaty by the UK side under the excuse of the National Security Law for Hong Kong SAR is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and severe violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations. The Chinese side strongly opposes this and reserves the right to take further countermeasures.The extradition treaty was signed between Hong Kong SAR, with authorization of the Central Government of China, and the UK side, and there has been effective cooperation on law enforcement all along. The recent unilateral move of the UK side will undermine the basis for judicial cooperation between Hong Kong SAR and the UK, hamper cooperation and exchanges between the two sides on law enforcement, and make the UK a ""safe haven"" for fugitives hoping to escape justice in Hong Kong.I hope the UK side will have a right and objective understanding of the National Security Law for Hong Kong SAR, right its wrongs, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, which are China's internal affairs in any form, and take concrete actions to foster favorable conditions for the sustained and sound development of China-UK relationship.Global Times: In light of the recent situation, do you think the China-UK ""Golden Era"", which was unveiled in 2015, has come to an end? If not, do you think it is faced with grave challenges?Ambassador Liu: The China-UK ""Golden Era"" was proposed by the UK side during President Xi Jinping's state visit to the UK in 2015. The Chinese side agreed with the UK side and supported this initiative because we believed that it was an accurate depiction of the development stage of China-UK relationship and served the interests of both countries. China has since then worked with the UK to advance the ""Golden Era"" of their important relationship.""Golden Era"" should be based on mutual respect, equal treatment and mutual benefit. In particular, the two sides should respect each other's core interests and major concerns and abide by the basic norm of non-interference in international relations. It is, to a large extent, up to the UK side whether the ""Golden Era"" could continue.GT: How do you see the future of China-UK relationship? Do you think there will be a continuous escalation of tension and serious confrontations between China and the UK, like what happened between China and the US?Ambassador Liu: We feel deeply disappointed at the current difficulties and setbacks in China-UK relationship. The UK side should take full responsibility for the state this relationship has got into. China-UK relationship is at an important juncture. The UK side should carefully reflect on its attitude and policy toward China. I think it is extremely important to uphold the following two principles:The first principle is to abide by the basic norms governing international relations. The UK was the first major Western country to recognize New China 70 years ago. Since then, China-UK relationship has kept moving forward despite twists and turns. History and facts prove that as long as the two sides adhere to the basic norms governing international relations, including mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, which are endorsed in the UN Charter, China-UK relationship will make progress; otherwise, it will encounter setbacks, or even retrogression. Recently the UK has made one mistake after another on issues related to Hong Kong and Xinjiang, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs and discrediting China. The Chinese side strongly opposes this. We urge the UK side to faithfully observe the basic norms governing international relations, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop flinging slanders at China.The second principle is to have a right perception and strategic definition of China. Some British politicians have clung to the ""Cold War"" mindset and danced to the tune of the US. They see China as a challenge, a threat and even a ""hostile state"", threaten a ""reckoning"" of the UK's China policy, and even clamour for a ""new Cold War"" against China. In particular, the UK Government's recent change of its decision on Huawei, excluding Huawei from its 5G network, is wrong. This is not only about how the UK sees a Chinese company. More importantly, it is about how the UK sees and deals with China. Does it see China as an opportunity and a partner or a threat and a rival? Does it see China as a friendly country, or a ""hostile"" or ""potentially hostile"" state? On these issues of right and wrong, the UK should have a right perception and accurate strategic definition.The UK aims to build a ""global Britain"" when Brexit is completed and COVID-19 is over, but it is hard to imagine a ""global Britain"" that bypasses or excludes China. The UK needs to coordinate and cooperate with China on international and regional issues, such as safeguarding multilateralism, supporting free trade, addressing global challenges such as climate change, and promoting the political settlement of hotspot issues such as the Iran nuclear issue, the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue and Syria. The UK hopes to enhance mutual support with China in hosting COP26 and COP15 respectively. Bilaterally, the mainstream of the UK society, especially the business community, hopes to deepen cooperation with China. China and the UK have highly complementary strengths and deeply integrated interests. There is a huge demand for cooperation in the areas of economy and trade, financial services, education, and science and technology.A steady and sound China-UK relationship is not only in the interests of the peoples of both China and the UK, but also conducive to world peace and prosperity. We hope that the UK will return to an independent, reasonable and pragmatic policy on China, and stop going down the wrong path leading to self-defeat.A view of Beijing Photo: ICGT: There have been discussions about whether China should impose sanctions on British businesses in China, such as HSBC, AstraZeneca, GSK and Jaguar Land Rover. What is your opinion? Will the Shanghai-London Stock Connect and London's status as an overseas RMB trading center be affected?Ambassador Liu: China remains committed to open and mutually-beneficial cooperation. We oppose politicizing economic issues and will continue to foster a fair, just, open and non-discriminatory business environment for foreign businesses. We think it is wrong for certain countries to abuse the concept of national security, violate the rules in international trade and exclude or suppress other countries or individual companies, and we are strongly opposed to this.Business cooperation between China and the UK is based on a sound bilateral relationship. There are close connections and mutual influence between business cooperation and bilateral relationship. This is the reason why many people from the British business community have expressed their opposition to and concern over the recent words and deeds of the UK Government.Recent years have seen remarkable progress in the financial cooperation between China and the UK, with London becoming the world's largest RMB offshore trading center and the second largest RMB offshore clearing center. The Shanghai-London Stock Connect links, for the first time, a Chinese and a major Western capital market. This bears great significance to both China and the UK. These achievements are not only reflections of the strength and status of London in international financial services. They have also benefited from the close relations between China and the UK. A steady bilateral relationship provides a solid foundation and guarantee for sound development of China-UK financial cooperation. Without this foundation, cooperation will be on shaky ground. It is our hope that the UK side will reflect on its recent remarks and moves with regard to China carefully and refrain from doing anything that undermines this very foundation.GT: What, in your view, is the role of the US in the recent change of the UK's policy toward China? Do you think the UK has decided on whose side it will take in the rivalry between China and the US?Ambassador Liu: The relationship between China and the US is at a critical juncture. China remains committed to working with the US to develop a relationship featuring no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. At the same time, China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests. It is our hope that the US will head toward the same direction as China, take vigorous efforts to implement the important agreements between the presidents of the two countries, and bring the bilateral relationship back on the track of coordination, cooperation and stability. The steady and sustained development of China-US relationship serves the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and meets the aspiration of the majority of the international community. China and the US stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Cooperation is the only right choice.Multilateralism and globalization are the overriding trend of our times and international cooperation is the common aspiration of people of the world. In international relations, different sets of bilateral ties could exist and thrive side by side. It is bound to be unpopular for a certain country to cling to the ""zero-sum"" and ""Cold War"" mentality, incite division along ideological lines, form an exclusive coterie and force other countries to choose sides. This will not win people's heart. China has never sought to change or replace anyone. Nor has it asked other countries to choose sides between China and the US. China is committed to mutual respect, equal treatment and mutual benefit. It is our hope that the UK will stay independent in its foreign policy rather than dancing to the tune of the US. ""Great Britain"" cannot be ""Great"" without independent foreign policies.GT: The US and the UK will sign a free trade agreement soon. What will be the impact on the business interactions between China and the UK? Do you find it necessary to re-consider a China-UK free trade agreement after Brexit?Ambassador Liu: I do not think the free trade agreement between the US and the UK will have any impact on the business relations between China and the UK. China-UK trade and US-UK trade are different in development stage, structure and complementary strengths. China has a strong production capability in manufacturing, with a complete system of industrial categories. We also have a consumer market of 1.4 billion people. These are unique strengths found in no other places. Reaching free trade agreements with both China and the US will benefit not only the UK, but also China and the US. The two agreements will not pitch China and the US against each other nor make one's gain the other's loss.With regard to the prospects of a free trade agreement between China and the UK, I think this depends, to some extent, on what policy the UK adopts toward China. The UK aims to build a ""global Britain"" after Brexit, but Britain wouldn't be ""global"" if it bypasses or excludes China, an important trading partner and an opportunity for future development. It is our hope that the UK will uphold the principles of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect, resist disruptions from other countries, and work with China to build closer China-UK business ties in the new era.GT: Some British and US politicians and media claim that the Sino-British Joint Declaration is a ""legally-binding international treaty"" registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations, which cannot be terminated unilaterally, and that the UK has the responsibility to supervise the implementation of the Joint Declaration. How would you respond to this?Ambassador Liu: Such claim reflects an ignorance of history. To help them brush up on the rudiments of history, I want to emphasize the following facts: The core of the Joint Declaration negotiated and signed between China and the UK is the resumption of China's exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. The basic policies regarding Hong Kong laid out in the Joint Declaration were proposed by China on our own initiative. They are not China's commitments to the UK or the so-called international obligations.China's position on the Joint Declaration is consistent and clear. After the handover, the Chinese Government governs Hong Kong SAR in accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR, not the Joint Declaration. All the rights and obligations with regard to the UK side in the Joint Declaration have been fulfilled at the handover in 1997 when China resumed exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. The Joint Declaration has eight paragraphs with a total of 1,137 words and three annexes. Not a single word, paragraph or annex gives the UK any responsibility over Hong Kong after its handover. The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of ""supervision"" over Hong Kong after its handover. Therefore, the UK side should not use the Sino-British Joint Declaration as an excuse to make irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong and interfere in China's internal affairs.GT: According to British media reports, Nathan Law, an anti-China element seeking to disrupt Hong Kong, and Simon Cheng, a former employee of the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong, are both in the UK and they are planning to use London as a base for the opposition forces from Hong Kong and even proposed the establishment of a ""Hong Kong parliament in exile"". What is your comment on this? If the UK Government allows such activities, how will China respond?Ambassador Liu: As I said when giving an interview to a British media last month, it would be completely wrong if the UK permits the establishment of this so-called ""parliament in exile"", and this will create a new and serious obstacle for China-UK relationship. Such an organization would be an anti-China organization aimed at undermining ""One Country, Two Systems"", dividing China and promoting ""Hong Kong independence"". If this were allowed in the UK, the UK would seriously violate the basic norm governing international relations, that is, respect for other countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity. It will also damage China-UK mutual trust and undermine China-UK relationship.I have urged the UK side, time and again, not to be bent on challenging China's sovereignty or supporting anti-China forces. Otherwise, China will resolutely strike back.GT: Some Western countries, including the UK, have seen Hong Kong as an independent political and economic entity. The Chinese Embassy in the UK recently and repeatedly urged the relevant British politicians to recognize the fact that ""Hong Kong has been returned to China"". Where does the wrong perception of these British politicians on Hong Kong come from? How to promote a right understanding on China here in the UK?Ambassador Liu: The world has entered the 21st century, but some politicians from Western countries, including the UK, have left their head in the Cold War years, or even the colonial era. They are locked in the Cold-War and colonial mindset, refuse to view China's development from an objective and reasonable perspective and harbor anxiety and misgivings about China. On the issue of Hong Kong, they do not want to recognize the fact that Hong Kong has been returned to China. Instead, they see themselves as the so-called ""supervisor"" and keep making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs. Recently, they hyped up ""China threat"", calling China a ""hostile"" or ""potentially hostile"" state, threatening a complete ""decoupling"" from China, and even clamouring for a ""new cold war"" against China. Such noise, although not representing the mainstream public opinion here in the UK, has created difficulties and disruptions to China-UK relationship.I think this is due to two ""deficits"" in the UK's current China policy, namely, the ""understanding deficit"" and the ""trust deficit"". These are one of the root causes of the current difficulties in China-UK relationship.China and the UK differ in history, culture, social system and development stage. It is natural the two countries do not always see eye to eye. The key to reducing these ""deficits"" lies in closer contact and communication between the two countries. Only by advocating dialogue instead of confrontation and promoting closer links instead of decoupling can China and the UK enhance understanding, deepen mutual trust, manage and control differences and reduce the ""deficits""."
Why does UK follow crazy US policy while EU stays sane? - Global Times,"Published: Jul 23, 2020 06:26 PM",Global Times,By Global Times,Opinion,"Illustration: Chen Xia/GTWill London and Brussels go separate ways in their China policies after Brexit? Signs have been emerging since the UK began closely following US' footsteps. By contrast, certain EU members are maintaining cooperative attitudes toward Huawei as well as China.The argument that the UK's post-Brexit China policy will completely veer off that of the EU is bit exaggerated. Yet there will surely be differences.UK's foreign policy was once constrained by the EU, but Britain also got support from the bloc so that it could maintain a degree of strategic independence from the US.However, once London officially divorces from Brussels, it will lose the backup strength. In this context, especially when the US is changing its China strategy while increasing pressure on its allies over related issues, the UK will inevitably get close to the US.But Brussels will not take Washington's side in a clear-cut way. In the end, EU members will prioritize their own national interests.Be issues regarding the Iranian nuclear deal, Paris Agreement on climate change, the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, Huawei's 5G technology, or US-Europe trade war, Washington has seldom taken into account the interests of its allies.The ""alliance"" is a concept which is used when they jointly face the outside world. Taking a look at the inside on the alliance, disputes over different national interests are easy to spot.Take Huawei's 5G. Washington showed little tolerance toward its European allies over their collaboration with Huawei. Yet it has never provided an alternative.What's Uncle Sam's plan? Making Europe suffer the losses along with the US? There is no way the EU won't be anxious in the current predicament - especially in an era of rapid development of digital technologies. US pressure is hurting Europe's interests.So the US tactic is trying to divide the continent and win over more of Europe's support, one country at a time. During US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's latest trip to the UK, he visited anti-China, pro-US lawmakers from the Conservative Party on Tuesday before meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson. What an obvious move to exert pressure on the UK's government.However, when most Western mainstream media outlets were busy covering how Pompeo was forging a coalition in Europe against China, they failed to intentionally or unintentionally touch upon the agreement reached on Monday between Brussels and Beijing regarding geographical indications (GIs), which is an agreement to protect products' intellectual property rights from the two sides.Although it was rarely mentioned in media coverage, the European Council called it ""the first significant bilateral trade agreement signed between the EU and China.""This is only part of the negotiations on investment and trade between the two sides this year. It proves that EU's China stance and China policy is pragmatic and that the big trend of cooperation between them won't be swayed.The EU is not seeking US-style hegemony, but is promoting its integration and strategic independence. Washington is obviously not satisfied with the aim since a stronger EU would pose challenges to the US. This is the reason why, since the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88), the US has been attempting to jeopardize the European integration. China, on the contrary, has been firmly supporting the process of the EU's integration.After all, the basic condition for the survival and prosperity of countries today is economy. The US manufacturing industry is waning. But China has the world's largest consumer market and labor market, it also has the most mature and comprehensive assortment of industrial sectors.The comparative advantage of cooperation with China is simply too obvious for Europe, which is yearning to revitalize its economy in the post-pandemic era. The irreplaceability of the Chinese market cannot be ignored. Would the EU fail to see that?This is also the elephant in the room for British policymakers. The UK ignored the sacrifice in its own national interests when dealing with China-related issues lately. This is just like what happened during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, in which the UK kept in step with the US regardless of whether US' moves were approved by the UN. Listening to whatever Uncle Sam has to say has become the political correctness of the UK.Nevertheless, it is believed the UK will eventually go back to the normal, rational path of its China policy. Take the Huawei issue. The country has actually left itself some leeway. London said it will remove Huawei from UK's 5G networks by 2027. At that time, the person in the Oval Office will have long been changed.The article is compiled by Global Times reporter Li Aixin based on an interview with Sun Keqin, research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn"
